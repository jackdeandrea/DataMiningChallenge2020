       "'Thanks. I made it up, that\\'s how I got over my first heart break.  They almost certainly weren\\'t consciously faking it, for those few years, they probably were \"changed\" and putting honest effort in to be more what their partner wanted. But, you can only fight your true nature so much and for so long, so eventually they return to their actual selves.  It\\'s why it\\'s so important to be honest in a relationship and to yourself.  It\\'s much better to find out you\\'re not compatible and be free to find someone with whom you are than it is to think you can \"suck it up\" or \"compromise\" or \"settle\" and have a life where neither of you are happy and you grow to resent your partner over what should have been. You\\'ve hit all the points.  She sounds like my ex wife.  No bueno. When I had libidio issues, I cared about it. I cared that my husband felt rejected or not good enough for me and I missed being able to enjoy being close and intimate with him. I did everything I could to be close to him, even if it wasn\\'t super exciting to me at the time because I was happy to be able to make him excited in the ways that I could. I also saw doctors and therapists for over a year before we finally checked my thyroid, which was low and the rest is history. \\n\\nThe OP isn\\'t describing someone who gives a shit about her SO--he\\'s describing an entitled person who is taking her SO for granted. She expects him to stick around no matter how badly she treats him. They are supposed to be partners and she doesn\\'t care about picking up her end of the slack. *That\\'s* the problem, not her low libido. &gt;Amazing relationship, appalling sex.\\n\\nNot so much. I don\\'t think you can have an amazing relationship with sexual incompatibility.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t end things I feel that you will be one of those poor guys posting over at /r/deadbedrooms.  Dude, it isn\\'t the end of the world, trust me. I was diagnosed with autism when I was about two, spent a few years in speech therapy, and came out with minimal social skills - hell, I couldn\\'t even talk to girls until about 4 years ago without a mini panic-attack.\\n\\nYou have to decide that you want to improve. I didn\\'t want to be that weird guy with no friends, so I \\'taught\\' myself social skills. I found people I admired and copied how they reacted, read about body language, inflections, threw myself into awkward situations. All of this I did until I could start developing my own personal reactions and \\'personality,\\' and then I practised enough that it became nearly automatic.\\n\\nSure, I come of a bit weird unless I focus completely on being \\'normal\\' (gives me headaches), and sure I\\'m still not great at everything (shopkeepers are hard) but I\\'m getting better, and even had my first girlfriend in April, although she cheated with my best friend so maybe it\\'s negligible. Point is, I\\'m better than I ever was, and you could do the same. It took years, but it\\'s worth it. you are a devil woman and this explains why your relationship failed &gt;another person fucking her with me or me on the side watching. \\n\\nSo, she gets off on the idea of humiliating you about as cruelly as possible?n  Not just fucking another guy, but actually doing it *in front of you*?\\n\\n&gt; she still wants to try. \\n\\nand she thinks you\\'re too much of a pussy to walk away.  It would seem  that she has some reason to hold you in contempt.  Are you in the habit of letting her walk all over you?\\n\\n&gt;What should i do?\\n\\nKick her to the curb.   You don\\'t need this shit. RUN. [Doesn\\'t matter had sex](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BtfyqO3V-tI/UE9cCqmoG6I/AAAAAAAAAE0/g1Dps60Ox-U/s1600/congrats+on+the+sex.jpeg) I think you\\'ve raised some valid points.  It\\'s okay to hate porn, and it\\'s also okay to reject dating someone that\\'s into it.  Ultimately, the intent of my post was to explain *why* I watch it.  Many will agree with what I\\'ve said, and a few will disagree.\\n\\nA large part of this controversy is internal.  It\\'s how you feel about it.  Then there\\'s how your partner feels about it.  If you have esteem or security issues, it will only be more difficult to wrestle with this scenario.\\n\\nMy letter was intended to put some of the insecurities people may have to rest.  Some people will not be swayed, no matter how convincing the evidence.\\n\\nWithout understanding, we can go no further.  This applies to everything.\\n Hell\\'s yeah this just happened Sunday night. :) Years of conditioning my friend and lots of practice!!! Very true, and it will definitely be a bit of a stretch, but not all of that is gone. He still has memories of his childhood, his friends in high school, etc. All still very relevant to who he is.  female no question/ you have to change who u are. you have to get past your self and give your self a chance to enjoy really great people. so there not 9-10 in looks but they are in being a lovely person. get on that. In most states 18/16 is completely legal.  Sudafed she lied because you keep backing her into a corner. batman!  even then! you do need help - professional help, especially if you have OCD. from this post, it seems like you have serious anger problems. you also seem kind of controlling. it seems to me she lied because it was easier to not tell you than to tell you and have you freak out. if i were her, i\\'d be second-guessing the relationship, so i think you need to calm down and have a CALM discussion with her about this.  i understand what you\\'re saying, but at the same time, i\\'ve never seen incorrect vs correct use defined for the withdrawal method. and since i suspect that most teens are just going to assume they\\'re doing it correctly, then they\\'re at risk of acting overconfidently. Not me but [this guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ocmOkBNT4) has.\\n\\n*Give it your risky click of the day* sadly, there is a difference between people who genuinely support men\\'s rights in a fight for equality of everyone (e.g. me) and MRAs who participate in nothing more than a reactionary, misognystic movement (e.g. the losers at /r/mensrights). you know, i have ocd as well. it\\'s extremely severe to the point where it can and does interfere with my relationship with my husband. but the difference between me and you it seems is that i don\\'t simply accept it and maybe even use it as an excuse to act poorly; i actively work against it to try and minimize any and all effects it has on my relationship.\\n\\ni disagree with what you\\'re saying about yourself. you sound very angry. you are proud of being arrogant, which is not a good thing at all. you are happy to be blunt, probably needlessly so at times. all in all, you don\\'t sound like a good partner at the moment, not because you have a psychiatric disorder but because you sound like an asshole, at least from this post. again, i\\'d like to encourage you seek professional help. it sounds like you really need it.\\n\\np.s. a more appropriate place to post this would be /r/relationships or /r/relationship_advice I see where you are coming from. But there is a reason why they broke up. Be a good boyfriend and let that be enough.  dude. almost the entire list of \"hot\" posts is talking about how feminism sucks, how male privilege isn\\'t real, women commit crimes too, it\\'s unfair that men should be punished for not paying child support they are legally obligated to pay... the other day (i\\'m on my phone and can\\'t find it at the moment) i saw a popular post there talking about how a man would have to be \"fucking nuts\" to date a modern white woman. please, tell me more about MRAs are for equality instead of just against feminism.  it sounds like you don\\'t want to be alone. if you truly love this woman, you\\'re not going to be ok with losing her, which means you have to treat her well. that involves putting effort in to controlling your disorder, for both of your sakes. it also involved shrugging off this ridiculous notion that it\\'s ok to be angry, arrogant, tactless, etc. those seem like defense mechanisms you built to protect yourself from the pain of being rejected and lonely. but you\\'re not alone; don\\'t you want to keep it that way?\\n\\ni\\'m really glad that you apologized to each other. you both did something wrong here (she shouldn\\'t have lied, you shouldn\\'t have overreacted), but hopefully, you\\'ve each learned something from this and will try not to act similarly in the future. good luck :) Purple Dragon If you have someone to share we may be able to work something out!!! i\\'m on my phone and can\\'t easily link. just go to the current front page of the subreddit, and you will see examples of what i just said.\\n\\nlook, i am very against the MRA movement as it stands today (though i am for men\\'s rights in general), and you are quite obviously supportive of it. you aren\\'t going to change my mind, and i doubt i can change yours. so let\\'s agree to disagree.\\n\\n obviously, we see the world in different ways. perhaps your own bias is affecting your judgment. like i said, we have different opinions on this topic that are unlikely to change. so this will be my last reply. Bananarama.  Poodle!  You are going to get downvoted, but you\\'re right about one thing -- it is the taboo of being an unethical person that is part of the turn-on of cuckold/cheating fantasies. It\\'s pretty common to get turned on by things that are \"naughty\", \"dirty\" or \"wrong\".\\n\\nOP, there are ways to indulge the fantasy without really hurting someone, but if your partner isn\\'t into it, it\\'s going to be difficult/impossible. And sexting against your mate\\'s will is *actually* cheating, it\\'s not a cheating fantasy. You\\'re not helping yourself. You\\'ll need to quit screwing around if you ever want her to indulge your fantasy, and frankly you\\'ll be lucky if she doesn\\'t leave you. Seconded. The birth control pill is designed to be your only contraceptive. It\\'s actually designed with ejaculation-inside-the-vagina in mind. \\n\\nThe efficacy of the pill works out like this: of 100 couples using the pill and having sex regularly for *a year* -- ejaculation and all -- *maybe* 1 of those couples will have a pregnancy result.\\n\\nIt\\'s great that you want to be extra safe -- couple it with withdrawal or with condoms, but NOT with Plan B. She\\'s already on hormones that interrupt ovulation. Taking more disruptive hormones won\\'t be good for her and it\\'s unnecessary anyway. Where\\'s Tiresias when you need shim? I am not sure how you can disagree with the statistical efficacy of the pill. Your experience -- and I absolutely believe you -- does not actually disprove that the pill is *highly* effective. There are unintended pregnancies with the pill, and it works out to be less than 1% of users with perfect use. You are one of the exceptions and your baby is clearly a miracle. :) I come from very fertile stock as well. Is this a death grip issue (masturbating hard and fast, result is a vagina isn\\'t stimulating enough)?\\n\\nMy boyfriend always says he gets more enjoyment from pleasuring me than from his own orgasms. Which is great and everything, but if he couldn\\'t ever cum during sex I certainly wouldn\\'t feel satisfied. I want to experience his physical pleasure too.\\n\\nI\\'d honestly rather work with a partner on premature ejaculation than delayed ejaculation because the latter makes me feel like I\\'ve let him down and I\\'m undesirable. Those are my own sexual hang ups, yes... but spending some time being \"selfish\" during sex is beneficial for everyone involved. I mean, sure, the situation may have been avoided if he\\'d noticed age was already in the post. But I think it was a misinterpretation to see his \"how old are you?\" as \"condescending\". It\\'s relevant information- something OP obviously agrees with as he included his age.\\n\\nFind a sexually compatible partner is not bad advice, as a lot of people really don\\'t seem to realise how important it is. \\n\\nIt is also not the only advice for OP\\'s situation. Fair is a really dumb standard to worry about in a relationship.\\n\\nThe question that actually matters, is _is everyone getting what they need out of this relationship?_\\n\\nIt\\'s not a competition, you\\'re not opposing sides, comparing \\'what she gets to do\\' to \\'what you get to do\\' is...not useful for the continuing success of your relationship. Are you happy with what you\\'re getting(regardless of what she\\'s getting)? Is she? You want the answers to both questions to be yes. Both of you being equally \\'allowed\\' isn\\'t important, each of you being _satisfied_ , is.\\n\\nIt might be unfair. Not really the point. We\\'re vanilla. Anal (on me, 23F) is as out there as it gets in our bedroom.\\n\\nWe fuck on average twice a day, we use lots of different positions... we\\'re very open with each other and very satisfied. Yesterday we were watching TV and he was whispering nonsensical phrases in my ear, because I find it hot when he whispers... and then he was like, \"suck my balls\". I grinned and hopped to it. As I did so he was like, \"Isn\\'t it fun to just be so comfortable with someone that we can do this stupid stuff?\" \\n\\nAnd yes. Yes it is.\\n\\nSometimes posts on here make me worried that my boyfriend is harbouring secret kinky fantasies he\\'s too scared to tell me about... but then I remember my boyfriend is brutally honest about everything/while this place makes it seem like everyone is into watersports/swinging/crossdressing/roleplay etc... that just isn\\'t true.\\n\\nWe love our vanilla sex life. Those are better but the chances of getting interrupted by someone are still high (fog in windows is a dead givaway of people doing it) I would try to find something in a industrial should sector. Factory distribution plant anything like that. Cops or public security go around parks on a regular basis after close time. I\\'m a guy.  It\\'s normal, and it\\'s hot.  Very, very hot. Fingering is absolutely bizarre when not done right. I once had a guy who just twisted his wrist, and I was lying there thinking, \"Um... whatcha doin\\', buddy?\"\\n\\nIt was even weirder because I *knew* he knew better. But it was what he almost always did. I\\'m not wholly comfortable with it, myself, though I love being talked dirty *to*. It\\'s the same issue, where in the midst of good sex my mind goes blank and I\\'m just too caught up in the sensations. I\\'ve found a compromise for the time being, where I just make my requests as dirty as possible. \"I need you to fuck my mouth,\" \"I want to cum all over your cock,\" things like that. &gt; the best alarm clock ever.\\n\\nThe best alarm **cock** ever.\\n\\nFTFY That always gets brought up on reddit but I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s wrong since girls masturbate quietly too and I don\\'t remember ever consciously keeping myself from moaning while masturbating anyway. I think it\\'s just because women are more expressive in general. Guys have to keep up a guard of not reacting openly all the time. This is all just baseless hypothesis though. Nah, if she\\'s putting down arbitrary rules like \\'no sex on a week night\\' and she\\'s down for some 50 shades of grey, I don\\'t think it\\'s about not being comfortable, I think it\\'s about being in charge and being selfish. She\\'s pushing you to see exactly how much power she has over you, how many hoops you\\'ll jump through to get to her vag. \\n\\nI reckon she\\'s got esteem issues. If you\\'re prepared to do all the work and settle for sex exactly how and when she wants it it shows exactly how great her vag must be. And that\\'s all you\\'re there for.\\n\\nWant to keep doing that for ever? Dirty talk is sexual pringles- once you pop you can\\'t stop. It\\'s lots of fun.\\n\\n\"My cunt is so hot and wet for you, please fuck me. I need you inside me so badly.\"\\n\\n\"I love the way you feel inside me, you\\'re so big, I feel so full. Don\\'t stop.\"\\n\\n\"Please, Sir, can I come?\"\\n\\nOr you can use it as an initiating thing, like:\\n\\n\"First, I want you to eat my pussy until I come, then you can fuck me\" \\n\\n\"I want to shake, and shiver, and moan, and sigh underneath you while you fuck me, hard and slow.\"\\n\\n    You just need to relax about it, but also you walk the knifes edge of one friend falling for the other emotionally. It happened to me. It is not a pleasant situation to be a part of. be sure its just sex, and if it is then screw her goddamn brains out.  /r/nofap The fuck? Your thinking just silly hun. i have small feet im only 5\\'7 and i weigh 130 pounds. im a very slinder person but i have a 8inch penis. When did shoe size mean thats hes dick size? switch shit up. dont do the same moves. From my experiences as a lurker/subscriber in /r/tall, I would say that the reason most women say they like tall guys is that they like how tall guys look and how being around a tall guy makes them feel. I know the sub is biased since people there that aren\\'t giants tend to really fancy tall people but...ehhh. maybe your not ment to be then if you two are burning out on each other. &gt; It\\'s a fantasy.\\n\\n.which she  persists in demanding.  Read the original post.\\n\\n Honestly, almost every fetish could be abusive, because abuse is a matter of attitude and lack of respect for your partner rather than the specific fetish itself. Granted, some would do more damage than others, I guess.\\n\\nTo answer your specific question, you need to understand what makes a person abusive. An abusive person wants to actually hurt you, or doesn\\'t care whether they hurt you or not.\\n\\nYour boyfriend has a fetish that involves blood. It\\'s not something he picked, and it\\'s unfortunate as it\\'s not the most practical fetish to have happen. However, instead of actually hurting you, he uses his imagination and pretends your period blood is something else.\\n\\nThat\\'s not abusive. An abusive person would want to actually hurt you. They would want you to be in pain. Faking it would do nothing for them. Your boyfriend has a fetish that is not his reality. He doesn\\'t want to actually hurt you, but the concept is hot to him. That\\'s why period blood does it for him. Because he can pretend.\\n\\nI don\\'t know your boyfriend, and it\\'s always difficult to predict who might be abusive or not. And I would never want to give someone a 100% guarantee. But I see good signs here, not bad ones. I see him finding harmless ways to work his fetish rather than harmful ones.\\n\\nIf he ever actually hurts you, that\\'s the warning sign. If he ever seems not to care about your opinion or consent, that\\'s the warning sign. As long as he makes sure you\\'re on board, then he\\'s not abusive, he has a fetish for fake abuse.\\n\\nDo you have a safe word? I would suggest picking one. You can also use the \"yellow\" and \"red\" method (yellow means slow down, red means stop). The reason here is that if he likes the fantasy of hurting you, and if you are comfortable with it, you could roleplay more, with you going \"no\" or struggling, etc. But if you go that road, it\\'s important that he always knows when you\\'re struggling or saying no for show, or when you\\'re doing/saying it for real. A safeword serves that purpose. Any other words, even \"no\", actually means \"yes\".\\n\\nAnyway, the way you phrased your post, it\\'s not clear if he\\'s into blood specifically, or if it\\'s just a \"side-effect\" for him. Guys being fine with having sex during a period are not as rare as a lot of people seem to think. If you\\'re able to have sex during that time (some women aren\\'t because of the pain) and want to, and he wants to, then have fun! Lots of people don\\'t get to, so enjoy :) &gt; EDIT: I looked at your post history, and you open admit to hating women. That explains why you flipped out at me for trying to help someone, and maybe save a life. \\n\\nHe openly admitted to being misanthropic, which would mean he hates people in general. A lot more common, as uncommon as it still is, with people at least labelling themselves misanthropes for the way it sounds edgy.\\n\\nMaybe he does hate people in general, I don\\'t know. My husband also has some uh - definitely not okay fantasies. We\\'ve got a mild Dom/sub relationship as well, and he\\'s definitely a sadist. However - he\\'s fully aware of the difference between fantasy and reality and would NEVER actually hurt someone in a way they didn\\'t like. \\n\\nAs long as your bf has a firm grasp on fantasy vs. reality, and you\\'re okay with his fantasies, there\\'s probably no issue. Just make sure you\\'ve got a safeword! You\\'re basing this off of his post in foreveralone?\\nMore specifically on a post dealing with people who seem abjectly miserable about their status regarding relationships?\\n\\nI skimmed his profile as well and it\\'s clear that he has many different issues to deal with. Someone posting in \"smalldickproblems\" and sucide-watch subreddits and things like that. \\n\\nTo that extent, his attitude isn\\'t healthy, but he clearly isn\\'t psychologically healthy/is depressed about various things and that\\'s going to be reflected in what he writes.\\n\\nNot defending if he says something that sounds stupid, just observing. Why are you so invested in telling this guy to stay with a girl who obviously has no respect for him? &gt;  Do you have any argumentation skills?\\n\\nOf course I do.  What makes you think you\\'re worth it?\\n\\n&gt; You have no idea whether or not she respects him\\n\\nSure,  the OP  could be making the whole thing up, but *if the situation is as he describes*, then she doesn\\'t respect him.  QED.  \\n\\nYou probably missed this part:  \" I\\'ve told her how i feel but she still wants to try. \"  \\n\\nNo respect  there.   None at all. I think it was more like some sub dealing with depression but I thought I read \"suicide watch\" or \"suicide prevention\" or something.\\n\\nBut yes-- he is quite obviously emotionally unstable, and to that extent I think it\\'s important to take some of the things that sort off or overly aggressive in the context of his psychological/emotional issues.\\n\\nHis claims of \"misanthropy\" most likely come from that, at any rate. Honestly it sounds very much like confidence issues where he feels he doesn\\'t deserve or hit the jackpot with someone so attractive.  \\n  \\nYou can wait for him to come around (heh) but if it\\'s confidence issues, you can really help yourself by helping him along the way by telling him exactly why you\\'re with him. Why you choose to be with him. How you find him attractive. What physical parts about him drive you wild (white lie if you have to but it\\'s most likely very important).   \\nIf he\\'s relatively intelligent, I would advise against force-feeding him all this as he might think you\\'re talking bubbles solely to boost his ego. Throw it into a conversation here and there. Get physical and touch his ass or chest or stomach or shoulders or anywhere else once in a while without making a show of it. Just a passing seemingly thoughtless touch.  sorry but the both of you are really killing me with all this arguing over penises.\\n\\nI must still retain a juvenile sense of humour because I\\'m cracking up. [Meta] cant be cheating if your not a unit. is it gaming. yes but you have to find a way to deal with that. Heres what you do you got to options. You fuck the fwb girl and then you go and see if things go well with the other girl. Or you just pay attention to the girl you like andsee how it goes but dont say no to the fwb girl. Keep the offer on the table and if things dont work out with the girl you like you got fwb girl to fall back on. But you are buying into it, you have to admit. \\n\\n\\nYou are getting actually bothered by someone who clearly isn\\'t in the right state of mind and clearly has many different things that bother him psychologically.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but the quote \"are you denying that most women prefer average or larger penises?\" and the term \"size queen\", which I\\'ve never heard before, really did it for me. My husband and I invited a really good friend into a situation like this. Everything went great, but I think it was because it was planned ahead of time. It\\'s been a few years since then, but we\\'re all still good friends.\\n\\nIt sounds like you\\'re in a more delicate situation because they practically coerced you into participating. Wait a bit, then make contact. Be very casual. You don\\'t have to bring it up or talk about with them unless you feel you really need to vent you discomfort to them. Live the dream So it does refer to actual people.\\n\\nBut no, I\\'ve never heard the term, so it must be an Americanism. \\nGranted, I don\\'t really talk about penises or penis size all too often with the people I know, maybe if I\\'m drunk or as a joke or something.\\n\\nIn vein of the conversation, I feel obligated to say that mine is \"big\" by conventional standards. Well...who\\'d call the police? Consenting adults and all that. Not sure of the legality of incest regarding adults. you lucky dog. I hope one day i to will have this. For me iv done nothing. Ive played video games, watch football and ate tacos all day. i like your thinking. you made your choice. My husband had an affair 5 months after we were married. He was gone for two days short of two months. I knew it wasn\\'t serious from the beginning, he was just running from our \"rough patch\".... At some point, everyone in my husbands life had bailed when things got hard, so he left before I could. Once his infatuation had run it\\'s course, he was back home asking if we could work through his mistakes. We went to counseling for 5 months 3-4 times a month. We did our \"homework\" and put effort into one another every day. The girl he cheated with was younger, terribly immature and posted youtube videos (even posted the videos on reddit), blew up his facebook, etc. Their two months together was broadcast for me to see, sometimes a song, memory or bad day can get me angry over it again but those are the days I need my husband to love me more. If we hadn\\'t gone to therapy, we wouldn\\'t be together. Communication was the only thing that saved our marriage. We are coming up on the 2 year anniversary of his leaving and I can honestly say I\\'m wayyy ahead of where I thought we would be. I was worried I\\'d never be able to trust again, but I do trust my husband. This is the happiest we have ever been. The grass is green where you water it. The more I put into our relationship, the more he does too. Not at all. I fantasized about getting my bachelor\\'s degree, and now it\\'s hanging on the wall of my room. I fantasize about fucking my boy, and I fuck him. Fantasies easily become reality.  Lack of confidence, insecurity, and nerves can definitely fuck a guy\\'s mojo up. My story:    \\n  \\nI\\'m  not too chubby but I\\'m not skinny either and had 3 partners total. Meanwhile, gf is unbelievably hot with the entire package, is 80 pounds right after dessert, shagged about 100 guys total, was prom queen all through out high school back in the day, and even had her own fan club.  \\n  \\nFirst time, nerves kept deflating my junk. I had the hottest girl naked and writhing underneath me begging me to enter her.....and it kept going soft. Had to fake it and try again the next day.     \\n\\nLack of confidence, nerves, the usual male sex pressure, all that definitely plays a major role in the bedroom for the guy.  Um... No. I fantasized about getting my degree while getting it. It was a lot of work but I enjoyed it. Fuck, I still think back on walking across the stage and taking my diploma. It was one of the most satisfying days of my life.  Wow this is almost my exact situation, from the OKC profile to the coffee place to the massaging. Damn.\\n\\nGive it time. See if he seems interested in hanging out (in a non sexual context). See if you do as well. This could just end up being an FWB thing, if you\\'re into that. Oh my god dude you really have problems  yea i just pop it in my mouth like a mento a keep on going  Yeah, it is. I didn\\'t sleep with the guy (no condoms) but I\\'ve met up with him twice now and each time was short but sexually charged. I\\'m interested in a real relationship, so I want to see if that can happen. \\n\\nIf nothing\\'s really changed by, say, the end of this month, then I call it quits. My ex was almost exactly like your husband. I did eventually get him off that way--as far as I know, I was the only one to do so--but it took several years (we were FWB first) and he had to be distracted. It only worked if he was simultaneously eating me out or concentrating on my pleasure, and I an count the number of times even that worked on one hand. after a certain point additional length is mostly about aesthetics because you\\'re not really giving much stimulation deep, and aren\\'t really a threat to slip out. Too much length can lead to a lot of comfort problems especially in regards to bottoming out. if you bottom out easily sex has to go slower.\\n\\nvaginal nerve endings are front loaded so more girth=more stimulation even if you\\'re not particularly long. obviously there is an upper limit here for pleasure that is variable for different people/orifices, but in general girth is a way better indicator if you can/can\\'t do something and how it will feel. FEAR ME DRAPE FEAR ME! Oh come on. Maybe that\\'s how it works for you, but some of us fall in love fast. I\\'ve had three long term relationships... each time I knew I would fall for the guy after our first one-on-one conversation. We certainly said I love you waaay before the four month mark. My parents dated for three weeks before they got engaged and then married six months later. Thirty years on they still gross me out with how in love they are.\\n\\nMy current relationship is certainly \"sex based\" - it\\'s a major way we express our love for each other. It\\'s healthy and it\\'s fun. yep its a normal activity to check in on humanity n let me know that im better or were i fail Where do you live? I think you\\'re confusing monogamy with exclusivity/fidelity. Monogamy, literally, means 1 partner. Polygamy/Polyamory/poly refer to having multiple partners. It says nothing of whether people have sex outside the relationship or not. Yes, I tried to emphasize the non-consensual aspect but seem to have failed. Recently, I haven\\'t \"needed\" the porn that much.  In fact it\\'s been probably a month now since I\\'ve seen any.  This is because my wife has been a lot more giving as of late, and my needs are being fulfilled.\\n\\nI\\'ve resigned myself to expecting a life with no threesomes, not by choice however, but because my wife is an amazing woman and I\\'ll honor and respect her wishes about it.  I can be content with what I have, even if I occasionally daydream about \"what ifs\".\\n\\nI always laugh at the \"because biology\" reaction.  It\\'s like saying \"I don\\'t understand science or innate desires\".  It just sounds jaded, that\\'s all.  Similarly, we could analyze the phenomenon of why women made 50 Shades of Gray hugely successful, despite its poorly written pages and S&amp;M antics with a billionaire.  We\\'ll use your expression to explain it -- \"because biology\".\\n\\nFor me, I have similar hangups about women that watch romantic films. At least in the sense that I won\\'t ever look like Ryan Gosling, we won\\'t ever have some romantic \"love conquers all\" moment, and for the love of God, there better not be any moments of me trying to compete against Mr. Wrong for the love and attention of my wife.  Romantic films set an expectation level that I find unrealistic and unsustainable.  They preach to you that your love life is boring.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, men and women are different.  We can embrace that and learn to have healthy relationships, or we can fight it and wonder why relationship-after-relationship fails. At the same time, there are a lot of bisexual women who are not okay with open relationships at all and will only be monogamous.\\n\\nThe argument that women\\'s sexuality is \"more fluid\" is bullshit- we\\'re just encouraged to be open about it because it\\'s \"sexy\" and \"exciting\" as opposed to men who are more often shamed for it. This is so politically correct it\\'s making me feel sick. Holy shit. It\\'s just too much. On a percentage basis, I totally agree, it is not that common. However this\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s very hard to find poly couples in most places, regardless of your area.\\n\\nis just not true. It is not hard at all, if you\\'re looking for them. Meetups, certain dating or common interest webistes and clubs actually make it very easy to find someone in the community. And then once you get your foot in the door, make a connection or two, it is a very network based community. You\\'ll find many many more by spending time with your newly made friends. \\n\\nNow, if you\\'re not trying to find them, yes you could potentially never find out that you have poly/nonmonogamous people in your life. No one I went to college with, no one I work with, no neighbors, no one in my family (with one exception) knows how my wife and I run our relationship. Most poly people are \\'closeted\\' in their workplace and extended friends and family. We don\\'t stand out, we\\'re not looking to have people find out, so they don\\'t.\\n This explains why, contrary to my pre-teen aspirations, never became a successful paleontologist/hacker. That\\'s awesome and you rock for teaching them. Keep up the good work! My motto is, if your sex doesn\\'t look like porn, you\\'re not doing it right. I\\'m a woman and I fuck a LOT and lemme tell ya, honey, it\\'s fucking fabulous and it\\'s just like the movies.  i\\'m literally learning french purely on a whim and for the sole purpose of being sexier in bed, and out of curiosity, i asked my fwb what she\\'d think if she heard me dirty talking her in french. She\\'s not a fan :(\\n\\n[But she loves giving blowjobs so...](http://i.imgur.com/y2Zwk.gif) You\\'re aware there\\'s tantric porn right? Lol. \\nIt\\'s rule 34... If it exists, there\\'s porn of it, because people like EVERYTHING. \\n\\nno you don\\'t understand...  EV. ER. Y.  THING. \\n\\n You\\'re quite stupid. Cheers and happy new year! I\\'m an actual German and I have to admit that it\\'s really hard to sound sexy in German. But try cute. There\\'s actually no language (except you\\'re literally a meowing kitten) that can sound cuter than German (the northern dialects); there\\'s the soft \"ch\", the \"r\" is rolled on the tip of the tongue, and even our word for \"cute\" (*\"süß\"*) is almost 100% soft \"s\".\\n\\nUNLESS YOU SHOUT ALL THE TIME! IF YOU SHOUT ALL THE TIME EVERY LANGUAGE SOUNDS HARD AND ANGRY! EVEN FRENCH AND ENGLISH! \"YES!! GOODBYE!!!\"? Midget AND a bullshitter, that\\'s an unusual combinat- No wait, it isn\\'t. I HAD FOUR YEARS OF FRENCH IN SCHOOL! I SHOULD PROBABLY POLISH IT UP UNTIL FEBRUARY WHEN I WILL VISIT A FRIEND WHO IS IN THE CHAMPAGNE FOR A SEMESTER! I CAN UNDERSTAND FRENCH WRITING BUT CAN\\'T FORM A SINGLE SENTENCE ON MY OWN! JE PEUX CONFIRMER! French is my first language, and, honestly, I just laugh thinking about dirty talking in French. Well, that\\'s an Austrian. That (and the microphone technology of the 30s and 40s) also explain why he has a rather hard pronounciation.\\n\\n[Here\\'s the Christmas adress of our president. (With a *real* sign language interpreter.)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eyBFnzRwnc)  \\nIt\\'s rather calm and if you spoke neither language you wouldn\\'t know if he was speaking German or English. You should add \"mademoiselle.\"\\n\\n*\"Pardon my French, mademoiselle.\"* like, not dirty talking, but just saying sexy french stuff like OP\\'s SO.\\n\\nI wonder when i\\'ll get to THAT lesson on Duolingo. And yet you\\'re the one making assumptions and generalizing tall people. Oh the hypocrisy. German is sexy, at least when a woman is speaking it. I think people (Americans) like French because.. it\\'s French. There\\'s also the whole foreign accent thing.\\n\\nHaha that would be cool. I know, but *mademoiselle* is more.. seducing. Something like that.\\n\\nEdit: Seductive. \"Attract (someone) to a belief or into a course of action that is inadvisable or foolhardy\" is not really what I meant, although.. Just reading and imagining this I think I came... I can see that Does s/he switch it up sometimes? My boyfriend is usually very quiet too. So those moments that make him actually moan or say \"ohh\" or \"fuuck\" (or both) that I know he\\'s *really* enjoying himself. He is learning that when he does make noise, I will continue doing what I\\'m doing (that he liked so much) so it\\'s like positive reinforcement. :D Makes me so happy.\\n Duh. It\\'s in reddit\\'s terms of service that you have to feel that meowing kittens are the cutest things in the universe. Exactly! In English, it works, but in French it just sounds weird and (sometimes) hilarious.\\n\\nIt\\'s like French is too precise, too literal. It\\'s a great literary language, but for sexual things.. not so much. Our president? No, that\\'s just because he was a pastor in his first career. &gt; \"I SHALL YOU COMPLETELY OUTSIDE FUCK YES!!!\"\\n\\nWhere the hell did you learn German? Yeah, Google translate is hilariously bad at German, but that\\'s what you get for having a highly nuanced language. Eh. Not my thing, personally, but I try not to judge people on their sex noises. Seductive? There you go! Why did you ever watch cheesy German porn? Haha, you are so funny. Do you know what countries\\' names also make hilarious jokes? Turkey and Flanders. /s I know how you feel. I don\\'t exactly have a problem like yours but I have fantasized about that kind of stuff and watched porn with those themes. It would always scare me afterwards.\\n\\nBut if you want, you can \"fix\" yourself. Firstly, know that you are always in control of your actions. There is a definite line between fantasy and reality, and you have the power to make sure it never crosses that line.\\n\\nSecondly, you may want to stop watching those rape videos and masturbating to thoughts of rape. You are conditioning yourself to get off under those particular circumstances, and it\\'ll only get harder to uncondition yourself the longer you go. If you have the willpower just take a break from all sexual activity for a few weeks and you may find that your sexual tastes will become more normalized. You can check out /r/nofap if you want help with that. Seems more like a natural instinct for protection rather than a shallow thing. And as a guy if I was 5\\'6\" I would certainly not want to date a woman considerably taller than me. I\\'m 6\\'3\" and I would still not like to date a woman who\\'s taller than me either, if being \"shallow\" helps me avoid looking silly, then so be it. Also there have been multiple studies done that correlates that the taller are the more you earn, and the more likely you are to get hired.

[I already commented on that shouting evil man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1u8kht/my_boyfriend_speaks_french_while_hes_fucking_me/cefn5sj?context=1) J\\'AI UNE GRANDE TOUR EIFFEL DANS MES PANTALONS!\\n\\n(We\\'re making Scrubs-references, aren\\'t we?) To add, I recommend using a little bit of coconut oil on the head and under the foreskin after a shower. Holy shit if my boyfriend did that I\\'d be an absolute puddle. Samesies. *Ughhhh*, so sexy. Shit. Let me get a pen and paper... Yet... First of all, you don\\'t HAVE to have sex.  You may be asexual? \\n\\nSecondly, it is no surprise that you haven\\'t climaxed with a partner yet.  That took me YEARS.  Especially since they\\'ve all been flings or one night stands - they don\\'t know you or your body.\\n\\nThirdly, stop faking it with your boyfriend.  How can he make it better if he doesn\\'t know anything is wrong? \\n\\nFourthly, try having your boyfriend watch you and help you masturbate.  If he can see how you do it, he can mimick it.\\n\\nLastly, work on enjoying the act of sex itself.  See what you guys can do that you DO enjoy.  It isn\\'t all about orgasm. Speak for yourself. I wish him luck in his past endeavors. You really thought you were the only who found German hot? Do you live in a cave or something? So you found our only weakness! (That and two-front wars.) That\\'s because most of the movie-Germans can\\'t speak any German actually.\\n\\nEspecially infamous is the Scrubs-episode with the two German brothers. Sarah Chalke (\"Elliot Reid\") is fluent in German, although she has the weirdest accent. Is that like a typical conversation starter for you? That might be the problem right there! Dexter\\'s lab FTW! As a sweet guy who would absolutely pound away at a woman until all the energy was sapped from our collective bodies, but is nervous to try, I\\'m glad women like you exist :-) It really does mean the same thing in both languages, huh? I\\'m sorry! You just had to ask!\\n\\nJ\\'AI UNE PISCINE CREUSÉE! Living the dream!\\n\\nBut, yeah, that\\'s a pretty nice advantage. ;) I\\'d always heard the height thing as well and I thought I was done when I grew a bit at 23 and my knees fused.\\n\\nThen my penis started growing again this year at age 26 and I\\'ve put on over half an inch.\\n\\nIt is pretty variable it seems. I\\'m at work right now, but I\\'ll give you some examples later.\\n\\nEdit: Okay, here we go. Sorry for taking so long!\\n\\nLet me start with a note/disclaimer: I am Canadian, not French.\\n\\nI did [some research](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/search?q=dirty+talk&amp;restrict_sr=on) to find some dirty talk phrases (in English). Of course, the word \"fuck\" is used pretty often. But what\\'s \"fuck\" in French? Well, the [direct translation](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#en/fr/fuck) is \"baise,\" but no one uses that. At least not my generation. There\\'s also \"foutre,\" but that\\'s used in \"va te faire foutre\" (go fuck yourself), so it doesn\\'t really do the trick. We use a lot of English words and expressions, but it\\'s hard to translate. It doesn\\'t have the same meaning, the same connotation.\\n\\nHere are some other examples with their translation and some explanation.\\n\\n* Fuck me/fuck me harder/I want you to fuck me/please fuck me\\n\\n  There\\'s the word! I don\\'t really know how to translate them without using \"baiser\" or \"foutre,\" but you could use \"to make love.\"\\n\\n* Your cock feels so good inside me/in my pussy\\n\\n  What\\'s \"cock\" in French? \"Penis\" is \"pénis.\" There\\'s \"queue\" (tail) and.. there\\'s \"bite\" ([cock](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#fr/en/bite)). If you use \"bite,\" your partner *may* start laughing uncontrollably. \"Queue\" refers to an animal\\'s tail, so that\\'s kind of weird.\\n\\n  \"Pussy\" and \"cunt\" mean \"chatte\" or \"minou.\" This has the same meaning as in English, but I\\'d still find it funny.\\n\\n* Fill me up/cum inside me/I want you inside me\\n\\n  \"Fill me up\" could be translated to \"remplis-moi.\" But that\\'s too literal! Do you want to empty her and then fill her up with water or what?! You could say the same thing for the English equivalent, though. For \"cum,\" we say \"venir,\" which means \"to come,\" or \"jouir\" (this one doesn\\'t exactly refer to the act of cumming, but the pleasure you get when you do). \"Cum inside me\": \"viens à l\\'intérieur de moi,\" or \"viens dedans moi.\" Again, that\\'s literal. Also, the wording is weird.\\n\\n* I want to cum all over your face\\n\\n  \"Je veux venir/jouir sur ton visage.\" This is weird, but it\\'s kind of the same thing as in English.\\n\\n* You make me so hard/You\\'re so tight/You\\'re so wet for me\\n\\n  If you say \"you make me so hard\" in French, it sounds like you\\'re *really* hard. Also, it\\'s hard to translate. The [direct translation](https://translate.google.ca/?hl=fr&amp;tab=wT#en/fr/You%20make%20me%20so%20hard.) doesn\\'t make any sense. It could be \"je suis tellement dur pour toi\" (\"I\\'m so hard for you\"). \"Wet\" means \"mouiller.\" But it really sounds like you have water or some other fluid all over you! \"Tight\" is \"serré,\" but we generally use \"tight\" anyway.\\n\\nThe following terms and phrases have (about) the same meaning in both languages:\\n\\n* slut, whore, etc. (However, some people might argue that it\\'s more degrading than the same words in English.)\\n\\n* You\\'re going to cum for me now.\\n\\n* Tell me what you want\\n\\n* Beg for (my [something])\\n\\nAnyway, I don\\'t know where I\\'m going with this, but here\\'s what you should know:\\n\\n1. People who try to learn French quickly realize that it\\'s more complicated than English: verbs, syntax, etc. English is simple and short. French is more complicated.\\n\\n2. English is a Germanic language; French is a Romance language. I won\\'t get into details (because I don\\'t know anything about that haha), but they\\'re different. It\\'s also possible that this has nothing to do with it, though.\\n\\n3. Like I said, I\\'m Canadian. The Canadian French language is heavily influenced by the English language (and so does French from France, apparently). We use a lot of English words and expressions. Why would we use French words instead? We sometimes take the word in English and conjugate it in French.\\n\\n  A given phrase in English can sound great, natural, and all, but the same thing in French can sound forced, too precise, or too literal (and degrading). (Cum, fill me up, etc.)\\n\\n4. We are ~~maybe~~ probably spoiled by the English language.\\n\\n  (Personally, I don\\'t like to watch dubbed TV shows or movies. I watch TV shows and movies in English.)\\n\\nThis is less concise than I would\\'ve liked, but that\\'s about it.\\n\\nBonus: In English, you can *like* something and you can *love* something. It\\'s very different. In French, there\\'s only one word for the two: \"aime/aimer.\" good way to start the year! i\\'ve never been able to masturbate to a gif. Sound is almost the best part.\\n\\n\\nedit: I\\'ve been subbed to /r/gonewildaudio for months, lol not everyone and their mother needs to tell me about it. But thanks anyway. haha People like you are the reason I love reddit so much sometimes.  \\n\\n/r/taylorswiftarmpit/   It may not be a brag post, but you deserve it. It\\'s great to see your sex life is still alive and well.  oh god dammit, there *is* missing data. No! You gotta keep going. I may get off faster, but I don\\'t fantasize about my own hand. Do. It. More. Haha what do you know. We have the same name except mine is formal. Nahh man I like the slow passionate stuff, and you hear the subtle noises. Both are considered to be correct.  It was a joke, actually. The word can be singular or plural as far as I\\'m concerned, I just really like the singular, in no small part because of Star Trek: The Next Generation. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m not shameful in the least about my preference! See my response above. Sorry, didn\\'t see that! \\n\\nHow dare you make jokes.  haha thats fucked up I\\'m old enough to remember dial-up, I had it for 3 years. I realize its a joke but idk why you have to say sound is a weak man\\'s masturbatory tool. Whatever gets you off gets you off.\\n\\n\\nedit: obviously cp, and other fucked up shit shouldn\\'t be included in that. Right arrow key?\\n\\n...\\n\\nI think you may have changed my life. i\\'m subbed already lol I\\'ve been subbed there for quite awhile yes yes but that isn\\'t masturbating to only a gif now is it? lol Roger, upvoted but hope I don\\'t run into them in public unless someone, anyone, is wearing tear away pants. Naughty snakes are so hard to find. Wait.... Yeah, if you start charting cunnilingus. &gt; I LOVE walking around like a raging horny beast\\n\\nTo each his own, that\\'s the definition of frustration for me.  Talk about not being able to focus. This is really interesting.  I love statistics.\\n\\nStrange how you never had 2 blowjobs in 1 day, but you did have 3 in one day.\\n\\nAlso, you said your longest streak was 10 days in a row.  Is that for sex or is that for masturbation?  If it was for masturbation, what was the most amount of days in a row where you had sex?\\n\\nAdditionally, I\\'d just like to let you know that I have been keeping track of the times I have gone to bed and woken up for the past 2.5 years, which is pretty cool too :P Learning to accept your partner\\'s sexual history is part of growing up, dude.  It\\'s good you talked it out with her but the best intimacy is when there\\'s no judgement and everyone\\'s mind is open. I\\'ve been in the same situation and women tend to keep this kind of thing secret since it opens up scenarios like the one you\\'re experiencing, or just general disgust and judgement.  If she\\'s mature and trustworthy, then she told you this because she thought you could handle it and wanted to show you just how wild she can get. That\\'s a good sign most of the time. well, Dexter had all the chicks :) I have an app that I use, but because it\\'s meant for people who are trying to conceive, it only has \"had intercourse\" as an option. That makes it tricky to know what to say, not just for every other acts (which I definitely want to count) but for things like \"we had intercourse but he didn\\'t come there\" which would defeat the point if trying to conceive, but not otherwise.\\n\\nSimilarly, that app doesn\\'t seem to care is sex happens once or more than once.\\n\\nOn that note, I\\'m curious about your reasoning for only counted times that led to completion. Do you mean completion for either one of you, both of you, or you exclusively? I note you did not count oral sex on her, which could be because you don\\'t do it, but could also be because you focused on your ejaculation, rather than sex with your wife?\\n\\nThat last bit is also supported by the fact that you included masturbation, which I assume in a lot of cases did not involve her.\\n\\nSo, are you doing it again this year? I was really expecting to open this and see \"None, she doesn\\'t love me. Please help.\" I don\\'t know. My girlfriend and i both have crappy gov insurance and it was still covered at planned parent hood. Even then though it only prevents pregnancy not std s. They have the info up on their site. One check up prior to the install, gynocologist exam and basic blood work. Second time was only a half hour. Slight cut to the arm it was put in. Butterfly stitched. Bandaged. And we were told to come back in 2 years 9 months to reschedule the next. But do a test every 3 months just in case cuz still a tiny fraction of a percentage that we could get pregnant. But yeah its nice not having to worry about birth control. While there make him get an std panel. You get one too as a sign of trust. \\n Dude talk to her her and tell her it turns you on to hear her moan and getting off. Not to keep it inside By biting the sheets and muffling it while pulling on blankets. Once she has done the grunting and moaning get a pair of wireless head phones so she can\\'t hear herself. Load up her favorite music. Put it comfortably loud. Start sex. She will be louder as she can\\'t hear herself and enjoy it more.  They were extremely irregular before which is one reason she got the pills in the first place. But since being on the pill you could all but time your watch by it. This is the first time its been late or even different at all in seven months.  And words are sometimes longer, syntax is more complicated, etc. I like being fingered in the ass but if he goes too deep it gets uncomfortable, so I don\\'t think I would like being fucked in the ass. well its not my problem if he is watching nsfw gifs at work I\\'ve done it, even been the one to offer. Or for instance say I\\'m too tired for sex so he starts jerking off, then he warns me he\\'s about to come (out of habit I guess) and I just move so he comes in my mouth. I\\'ve done that a couple of times I guess, because I felt like it (and because I knew it was okay with him, of course).\\n\\nNow, doing it regularly is fine. Doing it for a week in a row however, I don\\'t think I would like it as much, especially if it\\'s planned ahead that I\\'m supposed to. I prefer it spontaneous. I\\'d rather do it once a week on average over a year than a whole week straight once a year.\\n\\nWhy? Well, because doing it every so often would make me feel good. Doing it a lot over a short period, even if afterwards I wasn\\'t going to do it for a long time, would make me feel bad (taken advantage of, loved only for sex, etc, etc).\\n\\nI don\\'t think I can quite explain it. Too often would just turn me off. Feeling like it\\'s expected of me would turn me off. Being told \"hey, would you mind doing it every so often?\" and then being the one who offers would turn me on. Being asked to do it rarely and spontaneously would be fine, neither a turn-on nor a turn-off.\\n\\nSo, with that in mind, I wouldn\\'t want to experiment with it for a week, because as I said, if it\\'s planned for I just won\\'t feel like doing it, I\\'d feel expected to and taken advantage of if I said yes. Not all of them? Nobody is claiming it is impossible. It is also not guaranteed to happen every time. I just edited my comment! Oh I did, too. If you read further down, I was making a joke because I do know both are acceptable. but I do prefer the singular! Yes. As something that is my idea and that I decide to do as a treat, I can totally see that happening and I wouldn\\'t be uncomfortable with it at all.\\n\\nI guess I have a strong need to be in control, but I knew that already :P Lol thanks for trying, but I\\'ve been subbed to that for months. You don\\'t know how many people have responded to me saying the same thing. Ryan? Small world huh! ;) You\\'re kind of begging to get PID which can cause infertility, if that is of any interest to you.  If I ever decide to do it, I\\'ll make a thread with these answers, link to this post in my thread, and PM you about it. I\\'m not sure if I\\'d do it scientifically and systematically enough, but what the heck, a single person isn\\'t a representative sample anyways. I do. I love how neat they seem. Foreskin always seems so...extra. Condoms aren\\'t 100% safe either. For the sake of easy calculations let\\'s assume they generally know how to use either method, so the each method is 95% - 99.8% effective (let\\'s say 98%), so you\\'d have to choose between 2% risk of pregnancy during one year of sexual activity using one method and 0.004% risk using both. I\\'m a guy and the thought of my girl licking my asshole disgusts me I\\'ve never had it done nor do I want it to be done  As a 20 year old male, there\\'s a 99% chance I would not be down for this. I\\'m hairy down there, and in my experience, no matter how well I wipe or how thoroughly I wash, there\\'s always a strong chance I\\'ll miss something or not clean a spot enough to the point of erasing any negative poop-tastes (note that I said chance and not something equivalent to a guarantee). I just don\\'t think the pleasure possibility is worth risking have a girl I like enough to have in bed basically taste my sh*t. Plus, I think I\\'d have a pretty hard time giving this service to a girl (haven\\'t tried), so I\\'d definitely not hold a double standard in that situation where the girl does the dirty dirty and I don\\'t. \\n\\nTL;DR - It\\'s not worth the risk of having a girl\\'s tongue come into contact with something that might taste like my excrement. /r/nocontext Use your hands at the same time as your mouth. I\\'m pretty sure none of the top achieving men would publicly announce their porn viewing habits. I pass off porn viewing with the same \"everybody knows that\\'s fake\" attitude that you harbor towards Hollywood\\'s romance flicks. It\\'s pretty damned easy to notice when you\\'re doing something right. It\\'s not the Konami Code.\\n\\nWant to get better at oral? Start slow, and keep in mind the following:\\n\\n- is she not reacting? Try something else.\\n\\n- is she saying \"don\\'t stop\", moaning, and or bucking her hips? Keep doing that. Not true. Those are the most common causes, but certainly not the only causes. E. Coli is another, and it does hang out in everybody\\'s anus. This happened to me. I just kept it clean and tried to stop all sexual contact and masturbation, not the easiest thing to accomplish. It ripped for about 2 months.  Wow. Is it really one third? I was sexually active at 13. I hope you\\'ve talked to him about safety.  Some people don\\'t deserve respect. My conservative mother told me that I should kill myself because I was a useless whore. Yeah most guys on Reddit look at porn not all of them grew up playing Contra.\\n\\nAnd yes I had to Google that. Alas I\\'m on mobile, c\\'est la vie. There are dating sites for asexuals. If waiting for the \"right one\" isn\\'t important to you then why not spend a night with a prostitute? Liberate makes a waterproof bed throw just for sex fluids. They\\'re these ame brand that makes the ramp/wedge cushion, etching. Much better alternative to puppy pads. Yeah I\\'m just not too hot on the idea of waxing, especially anywhere near where I poop haha. But to each, their own, I suppose! I hope it works out for you. What are his reasons? Yes, but the important part is *why*. Is it a religious thing? Did he try other positions before and have a bad experience? Has he even tried other positions? Is it a fear of injury in other positions? Does he think you enjoy the (non)curve of his dick better in missionary? Are other positions uncomfortable to him? Are they visually unappealing? The why is pretty important so they can actually discuss it, though. If it\\'s just, \"I don\\'t like other positions,\" versus, \"But I want to try other positions,\" you\\'re just going to get the two people arguing in circles.\\n\\nFind out *why* it\\'s the only position he likes, so the *how to communicate* and potentially alter their sex life *or* determine they are completely incompatible. As an example, if he firmly believes missionary is the only acceptable position for his own religious reasons, they\\'re going to be incompatible. But if he\\'s just worried about potential injury, some research, education, and/or experimentation could help. Yeah, then this just sounds like out-and-out incompatibility. If you\\'re not being satisfied and it\\'s a dealbreaker, then I wish you luck in finding someone who can match your interests and desires. Sorry. I wish I had a better answer. Sometimes when I\\'m upside down an she\\'s sideways and my hand is reaching round under her leg from behind, I find it quite difficult to find the right spot! I always described it as feeling like I was going to be laying an egg. I know that\\'s very odd but it really does feel wider and raw. That item would be found in the *BEYOND* section. This is definitely it for me. It doesn\\'t feel good and happy til we are done. Same. Still bisexual- I\\'m just heteroromantic. My wife gets off significantly better with PIV Lying down with my hands behind my back or tied up and having her sit on my face. Major turn on for me I say this because i dont see anyone else say it and they have said all the other things i would have said. For me this is a big deal. I HATE being promised something and then someone not deliver. Im well and dandy if you say something may happen but not to freak if it dont but if you promise X you better be bringing that Xor i get angry.\\n\\nMy advice to you is if it dont go down you can be upset but dont let it ruin shit. There is always next time. Since your very green let them lead but let them know how green you are. SHe seems to know so thats good. So be ready, be safe, go at your pace, listen, communicate. \\n\\nOH! and have fun. always, have fun.  this has happen to me twice. I was freaked out to. LIke i use to be a marathon runner and then boom i could not even finish the 400. It was both with new partners so i was way to hyped and at that time i was not getting some regularly and jerking off the way i was at the time only mad it worse. \\n\\nWhat i did was realize that if a few things worked for me. I can go at least twice so get off once in foreplay and then round two i get it going. then i would last my normal about of time \\n\\nSo i blame it on being with new partners masterbatory habits and being to excited. Also a little trick that works for me is when im in the women i hold the base of my cock and guide it in while im thrusting and then have the other hand on her. It holds me break pretty well and its not to overly uncomfortable. well why not both? really though thats your choice. i dont know this men and i cant pick for you. What the redeeming qualities of each of these guys, who do you feel more attracted to? Stuff like that.  the best way to get past the feelings of ridiculous and silly is to get serious. Drill it in your mind that this is something you gotta do and it will be 1000000 times more sexy if you bust in there with skills and not looking like some goof giggling. I HATE THAT. Iv gotten lap dances from women who knew what was up and some ladies that are just nah, they think they have to do the \"stripper moves or they keep touching there hair and giggling. No women your giving a lap dance this is better when you mean business and are not laughing and fucking touch me.\\n\\nIt really dont matter what your body build is its about how close you can get with her. Dnt smile unless she is but do not do a toothy smile do a seductive one give her a wink an then get back to it. Think of it like this. If you know how to dance and grind then all that is different is that one is sitting down. well as guy/bi/ what ever they are im sure they would be super down with this.  im not attracted to guys really. Like i know what a good looking dude is i dont walk around the mall thinking damn i bet his dick is huge i want to suck it and then walk up to him and be like oh hey yeah lets go to the bathroom etc etc. NOt like this stuff has not crossed my mind though from time to time.. Just thought i could help because i have opinions on like everything and i just like to help people :). Im a student of humanity so human relations are very fun for me so any help i can give im down to.\\n\\nTake this info with you, let them lead, if your uncomfortable let them know, if you want to take things further also let them know and for the most part just enjoy. Have fun!\\n\\nWho would you say if you had to pick one who would u rather? what are the pros and cons of each. If i know those i can give you an option on what i think but the choice is yours. age gap to be honest would be less of an issue then if stuff got way to strange with your neighbor since you know he lives next door... \\n\\nTHat being said though if things go super well with your neighbor then get ready for mega fun because well he lives next door!\\n\\nLike iv said its all up to you and what you think you can handle. Think with both heads ;). I suppose if i was you make a list of pros. Put the guys on each side and then go down a list of things you like. Who ever has more check marks  pick them. \\n\\nSince this is your first time id say dnt do both unless your ready. Two dicks can be quite a deal and idk what your looking to do top/bot/vers/hj/bj etc etc... also dont really know your character, do you want to be in control or do you want them to.\\n\\nMake the list pick the more pros. If you do pick both let them know and i guess be ready to be doing extra work. yes You could always up or down vote the submission, from your overview page there are links to liked and disliked Alright and hes older so he may know more then the younger guy. GO FOR IT! \\n\\nLet me know how it goes if you want. Have fun. bring your own condoms and lube and make sure you are comfortable at all times. I think him taking you out would be a nice thing to do. Not sure since your bi cur if your just curious in the sexy times or actually dating men. Since you know him for quite awhile so the dates not really needed haha. Vimeo? I\\'m not sure of their exact policies, but they seem to be less restrictive than Youtube. well as a sexual being waking up to a naughty/dirty/slutty message is never looked down on. il be here for a full report when you get back haha. well you say what happen duhh. did thing go well/was it what you wanted/will you do it more/ will your neighbor get a chance. your a character of my internet now haha so this storyline is less awesome without the pay off. it like watch a movie and then leaving with 20mins left in the film. touchdowm? You assume correct.  \\n\\nThanks for the advice! There\\'s a huge difference for me! I am very attracted to men in a raw, primal, sexual way. I have casual sex with men and enjoy it a lot. I also have serious relationships with men, but warm up to them very slowly... usually my relationship timeline with a man goes so that we\\'re friends for a short time first, then we start sleeping together, then after a while of that maybe we\\'re casually dating, then after several months of casual dating we\\'re in a relationship. \\n\\nI\\'m almost demisexual when it comes to women. I get crushes on women slightly more frequently than on men, but I don\\'t have sexual attraction to women in general, just a few specific ones, and my sexual attraction develops only if I also have a crush. Sexual attraction usually doesn\\'t happen for weeks after I develop a crush!  I held hands with a girl. Platonically. Still the most intimate physical contact I\\'ve ever had with a person. good for you highfive They don\\'t go on your nose! I had sex on MDMA with a FWB after ringing in the new year. It was wonderful. 1. No. When a dude feels good inside me, I let him know. \\n2. I never have the patience for reverse cowgirl, I lose the D so often, I\\'m like, fuck it.\\n3. Really you need to be be able to have an open and honest conversation with her about this if it\\'s bothering you. \\n\\nI don\\'t think you have a particularly large penis. It sounds pretty average. However, speaking as a woman with a small, quite shallow vagina (I can touch the tip of my cervix with my finger)- it would feel big to me.\\n\\nYou are one part of the equation. Remember that. $$$$ can get u anything look up trick that might help. maybe lean forward more and let him be on fully on his back. What is it that he is getting pain in?  I\\'m not just going to recommend ending the relationship, but I am going to recommend informing the police about this. Certain sexual urges, if acted on, just aren\\'t healthy and this is one of them. I\\'m not talking about rape fantasies in general, I\\'m talking about rape fantasies in people who are incapable of not acting on them. Your boyfriend is raping you, serially, and if you\\'re not in a relationship with him then chances are he\\'ll be raping someone else. He needs help. Immediately. I\\'m attracted to confident guys who are sexually assertive. So it seems unlikely that I\\'d find myself dating a 25 year old virgin... but if that somehow did happen, if I was super attracted to him... it wouldn\\'t stop me.  People smarter than me have said a ton of usefull/insightfull stuff already, but in case it hasn\\'t been said yet, urge him to lay off the porn for a while. It\\'s been documented that over-stimulation to porn (in other words: having every babe/fetish on the planet a mouse click away) can result in the extremification of one\\'s sexual arousal \\'bar\\'.\\n\\nIn other words, \\'normal\\' porn doesn\\'t do it for him anymore. He needs the extreme factor to get off. It\\'s tampered with his definition of sex, and it needs to get out of his system if he were to become \\'normal\\' again. Just my 2 cents. This is why safewords were invented. We\\'re saying that she should respect herself and LEAVE the relationship. Then I guess you guys weren\\'t in love? It doesn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe it\\'s an orgasm. I\\'ve had orgasms and this is different. That\\'s a possibility. /r/sex needs a special induction into the /r/firstworldanarchists Hall of Fame. What about Plenty of Fish or OKCupid? OKC definitely is; I have no idea about POF. Good luck! &gt;I know how to play the game\\n\\nWhat game? Meeting someone for a physical or romantic relationship is not a game, it doesn\\'t matter how you act on the outside, this shitty attitude you have on the inside will always show through your acts and games. I\\'m sorry to give you some tough love, but you really need to change your outlook on sex and relationships if you ever want to have anything meaningful and lasting. So what if you have to wear diapers? Love does not have to be something you feel because the other person is perfect, love is something you feel despite their imperfections. A girl can be attracted to you despite your disability. Stop trying to pick up chicks and start trying to make real, human connections. Maybe fantasy football. Somehow I don\\'t see a man in his 40s interested in risking his aging body for something like football. Nobody gets it, the world has nothing to offer you, you know everything and there is no solution. Don\\'t tell me I don\\'t understand cynicism, depression, and negativity; I\\'ve been there, I still visit there from time to time, I know what that does to you, how hard it is to put on a mask every day and pretend everything is okay, you can try and fool people all you want, but I can tell from the way you write that you\\'d rather not. You shouldn\\'t be worrying about trying to get laid or start a relationship when you have much bigger piles of shit on your plate, it isn\\'t fair to anyone to drag that stuff into any type of relationship, even a simple relationship. Depression is a treatable and manageable disease, stop blaming your physical disability for your relationship problems and start looking a bit deeper.  \\nAlso, the stuff about your past girlfriend cheating on you has nothing to do with your disability either, that was her choice and you\\'re not to blame for that, she would have cheated on anyone.  \\nGo ahead and tell me I\\'m completely wrong and still don\\'t understand, I\\'d say the same thing to someone telling me this, but I want you to at least consider that things that you cannot control are not the reason for your unhappiness and failure, your attitude and reactions to those things are the reason. Okay, let\\'s ignore your obvious cynical outlook on life and focus on the phrase you used a couple times: \"play the game\", what is this so-called game you think you know how to play? Is the goal of the game to sleep with a girl, find a girlfriend? I don\\'t understand why you think meeting someone is a game. I don\\'t understand why you\\'re even looking for help, it sounds like you just want people to agree with you and say \"Yup, you\\'ve been dealt a shitty hand in life, all girls are bitches because they won\\'t sleep with you and one of them cheated on you.\" Stop blaming all women for the actions of a select few, start trying to be a better person for the girl who couldn\\'t care less about your disability, give up this non-existant \"game\" you\\'ve made up. Ignore the things in your life that you can\\'t change and start working on the things that you can change, make real change, don\\'t keep covering up your faults, be yourself. The only \"game\" you should be playing is the one where you become the best version of yourself that you can be.  \\nI know I\\'m still wrong, and nothing I\\'ve said will help, nothing anyone ever told me helped, but one day you\\'ll be a better person and remember the people who weren\\'t willing to validate your cynicism. And that is another reason why people don\\'t have kids . you could always just use an enema to clear everything out. or just wait and let the body absorb it  Thank you so much for saying all of this, even if it doesn\\'t get through to him, I think this is all really important stuff for a lot of people to hear. I was once recently in a place where I saw all forms of empathy and attempts to make a connection with me as personal attacks and rejection. It\\'s really tough being in a place like that, especially for someone like me who is stubborn and wants to do everything on their own. But I\\'m now in a much better place and can see much clearer. Just wanted to share that and say your words are very helpful. Mine will often flow a lot, stop, flow again, stop, and flow a little. Her body may just be reacting to stressors. Give it a few more days; if there is still concern, just take a pregnancy test to confirm/erase all doubts. Why not give her both. Or vaginal, clitoris AND g-spot. I feel lucky that I am able to give my girlfriend all of these, and she feels even more lucky. The best feeling is experiencing her totally exhausted from pleasure, falling asleep in my arms.  Go to a sugar daddy site. My friend did this, but she preferred the companionship sort rather than the ones who wanted sex. It worked for her for a while. It was almost a week ago for less than a minute and I we were both really drunk. So it\\'s really more of a fuzzy memory at this point. Nice to know that it happened, but it would have been much nicer if it had happened before I had almost finished my undergrad. It\\'s total weight, and has to do with the concentration of the chemicals in question when they are circulating through your whole body.  Since you\\'re a taller woman, you\\'ve probably been told at some point in the past that it\\'s OK for you to take more ibuprophen then the bottle recommends, right?  Same basic principle.\\n\\nIn the case of Plan B, there\\'s a threshold effect.  Rather than just being in more pain, as with ibuprophen, there is an insufficient concentration of key chemicals in your uterus to prevent ovulation, fertilization, and/or implantation.  As a man married to a tall Scandinavian lady myself, it\\'s kind of a bummer in principle, but it just means that you\\'ve got to be a little more careful otherwise. They just feel completely different. My reactions are also very different from the two types of orgasms, for example. You may be using a bad technique. You say your fingers get tired- are you using your fingers and wrist for movement, or is the movement coming from your shoulder/upper arm/elbow? If you move with those muscles instead of your fingers and wrists you won\\'t get tired as quickly. Anterior means the front. The definition you linked to says the front. Posterior is the back. She would have to be on her stomach for him to be able to press downwards and stimulate her g-spot. If she was on her back he would have to press up/towards the ceiling. He was talking about having his hand hooked up against her vulva with his thumb inside of her vagina, and pressing down with his thumb to stimulate. Let\\'s not. Mirrors + Eyes = Not Real. I think we all have those moments. :) Because Plan B is different than normal BC.  For Plan B to work, it has to incite a number of pretty radical changes in your body in a *big* hurry.  Regular BC, by contrast, is a low-dose, long-term medication; the two, physiologically, function in fundamentally different ways.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example.  If you take 81mg of aspirin daily and you have high blood pressure, your blood pressure will come down, gradually, over the course of several months and reduce your overall risk of heart attack.  This dose will do nothing whatsoever for pain relief, because the amount is below an effectiveness threshold.  By contrast, if you take three 200mg aspirin pills once a week, you\\'ll get a nice, powerful dose of pain relief and a notable thinning of your blood, but no change in your overall risk for heart attack, *even though you\\'re taking the same amount of aspirin over the course of the week*.  The same drug, administered in different ways, can have radically different effects. As with everything, practice makes perfect. Communicating and having her say \"lighter/harder/this way/that way\" helps. Using very subtle shoulder and elbow movements is enough.\\n\\nIt works for my SO and I. His arm doesn\\'t get tired as quickly and I actually tend to get off better because he can use more pressure without hurting himself. Obviously it\\'s just my personal experience but I\\'ve never experienced such a slight change of angle cause pain when stimulating the g-spot since it is so close to the entrance of the vagina, let alone \"excruciating pain\". The only time I have experienced pain is from something that could be caused in a number of positions and not just this one. Well, if she already likes g-spot orgasms, just changing the mechanics of how you apply those movements (small shoulder and elbow tweaks instead of what is much more significant movements in the wrists and fingers) it should be the same or similar in the end. But yeah if a guy is a dolt and thinks that porn = real life and jackhammers away with his fingers it\\'s not going to be great regardless if it\\'s wrist or shoulder movements. I scrub mine religiously, and I mean SCRUB! As for trimming/shaving, I dont let it get out of control since im single, but if I were to get a heads up for some fun or were with someone, it would be neatly and very closely trimmed (Shaving causes too much irritation). Pardon me? Add a few passes on the caboose, too. Nothing worse than dried swamp ass. Who is Jason? My SO trims with guarded clippers. He likes the feeling and now says it feels weird when he doesn\\'t keep them trimmed. He only does it about once a month or so and it only takes about 10 minutes so it\\'s pretty low effort. Baking soda is terrible for your skin- vinegar would be more gentle and once it washes away the odor of vinegar is also gone so there\\'s no issue with that. You meam? You can, if you need to.\\n\\nSo, here\\'s why you\\'re only supposed to take as little pain meds as you can.  Ibuprofen is spectacular at alleviating subcutaneous, and particularly dental, pain.  However, it\\'s a complex compound that your liver needs to clean out of your bloodstream, and doesn\\'t have a very easy time doing.  Hence, if you take too much ibuprofen for too long, you can get liver damage.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a bigger person, however, you need more ibuprofen in your bloodstream for it to affect all the pain receptors it needs to affect (remember, an increase in size increases your total mass along the square-cube rule, which means in laypersons\\' terms that you get heavier more and more rapidly as you get bigger).  More, your liver is going to be larger (proportionally, your liver could be almost 20% larger than a small woman\\'s, if you\\'re quite tall), which means that the labor of cleaning the ibuprofen is going to be spread more evenly over a larger body of cells.\\n\\nSo, let\\'s get down to brass tacks.  A standard dose of ibuprofen is two 200mg pills, and is targeted at a person who weighs, on average, about 140 lbs.  This weight is chosen because it\\'s a midpoint between average male and female weights, but it\\'s biased a little toward the ladies\\' side because ibuprofen is so good at relieving menstrual cramps (women use more ibuprofen than men).  If you\\'re a little 5\\'0\" woman who weighs 105 lbs, taking that standard dose can, over the long run, do some really nasty damage to your liver; you should only take one pill or maybe a pill and a half (that\\'s why the long ones have that little divot in the middle--to make cutting them easier) as a standard dose, and two for intermittent, serious pain.  If you\\'re a strapping lass of 6\\'0\", though, you\\'re probably 175 lbs or more, and a standard dose won\\'t be very effective.  You\\'ll need a third pill for reasonable effectiveness levels, and might even take a fourth for serious pain.  Your liver, being much larger than your short friend\\'s, is able to handle the additional stress such a high dose puts on it, so you really shouldn\\'t have anything to worry about.\\n\\nAnd, just as a side note, never take ibuprofen on an empty stomach, and especially not larger doses.  It can damage the lining of your stomach as it dissolves in your stomach acid.  Even a little half-slice of bread is generally enough to protect you, though. It could be that too much of your stuff smells like him so it\\'s not as distinct and is more of a subtle \\'background noise\\' of smell. When I spent the weekends at my SO\\'s place before we moved in together I would hardly notice it, but when I pulled out his undershirt I kept at my own house and smelled it, it was like an awesome slap to the face of his scent. There\\'s actually a history behind this.\\n\\nWhen IUDs were first introduced in the 70\\'s, if memory serves, there was a serious flaw in the design of the leading design.  This caused some really bad results, like ruptured uteruses and a whole host of other horror show things.  The device was recalled and the modern capital-T design was developed to solve those problems.  Modern copper IUDs are super safe (long term, way more so than hormonal BC).  We love ours. He doesn\\'t want to be clean shaven (and I don\\'t really like that either) so a straight razor wouldn\\'t make much sense. Sugar mamas? Very likely. I\\'m not very familiar with these sites though, so do some research. I\\'m sure there exists a relevant subreddit. My penis is cleaner that the sink fixture knobs in a public bathroom. Wait, I need to *wash my genitals* in the shower!? I\\'m clean, but I refuse to budge on my long hair and beard. My hair is nicer than most women\\'s, usually at least one drunk girl plays with my hair at any party I go to, and my beard is thick, even, and warm.\\n\\nI\\'m working on dressing nicer, the one drawback to the long hair is a lot of clothes that look good with short hair look odd with long hair.\\n\\nI\\'m slowly getting there on the confidence, it helps that I can occasionally recognize some interest from women. Still don\\'t act on it, but I\\'m aware it\\'s there, so I\\'m doing better than I used to. LOL  Lol that was funny :D &gt; or I have to grab her neck and growl \"pay attention, slut\"\\n\\n... I think I need this to happen to me now. That sounds incredibly hot. Not really.  My mom and brother are critical care nurses, and I\\'ve had my wisdom teeth out.  Didn\\'t care for the codeine, so when I switched to ibuprofen, I got an earful on how to dose myself properly. Well, your fingers laying flat wouldn\\'t take up that much room and it\\'s not like she\\'d be glued to the bed, and only his fingers would be under her, not his whole hand. I mean, I\\'ve grabbed a lot of my friend\\'s dicks, so yeah, I\\'d be ok with it. I\\'m a grower, so my dick is like 1.5 inches and shriveled up when I\\'m peeing. I have to grab it and pull it out and pull the foreskin back and aim it so it doesn\\'t splatter everywhere. Make your hand into a C-shape but keep your 4 fingers straight. The thumb goes into the vagina (it\\'s short so it hits the g-spot almost perfectly, some adjustment may be necessary.) The area just below the fingers (so where your knuckles would be, but on your palm) would rest just above the vaginal opening, likely touching the clitoris. Probably not the entire length of your hand would touch. Fingers would rest over the mons.\\n\\nThis could be done with the woman on her back but that would require some positioning on the male\\'s part because it may be awkward to have their arm held like that with palm facing downward and be able to continually provide stimulation.\\n\\nOften one or two fingers are used inside and the thumb is used to stimulate the clitoris. It\\'s basically just flipping where the fingers go, and obviously it\\'s the palm on the clit and not fingers since they\\'re too long.\\n\\nSo if she is laying on her stomach, the fingers would be, at least partially, between her pelvis and the bed. It could be. The arm is the more awkward part depending on how you\\'re both positioned usually. Chances are her hips won\\'t stay completely down for long if she likes g-spot stimulation and it\\'s being done right, too. technically everyone pays for sex. Dinner, movies, flowers, jewelry. With escorts you just cut out the middle man \\n\\nI personally have always had threesomes with people from my social group but since you don\\'t want to do that, take your boyfriend to a bar or some sort of social place, ask him to find someone he finds attractive and you two both start a conversation with that person, get to know them and see if they are a good fit. It doesn\\'t have to happen right a way, in fact I would advise against that, get to know the person you are bringing into your bed room. \\n\\nas far as it goes during sex it never really ends up as 1 on 1 with 1 watching, just get into it. Or your guy will bring you into you. You just have to remember to be comfortable and let your inhibitions go. \\n\\nNow as far as after sex goes, really you can do what ever or set rules for what happens after.\\n\\nI have had a 4 threesomes, yes they are great but as a guy it is a lot of work to maintain that both girls get equal satisfaction. Hope that helps a little  You\\'re welcome, and yeah I understand the not wanting to ruin friendships  they make numbing spray that dulls the senses a little, so that with a condom and you got more time  hey, I\\'ve never seen it either. though I do have the standard of: If I invite you to do something I will pay for it, if you invite me than you pay for it   I don\\'t think you know anything about women. I mean... one night my boyfriend and I had been arguing, we were in bed, I was upset and angry, he was frustrated and angry... I stopped speaking to him for quite a few minutes... eventually backed my ass into him, got him hard and then we fucked. No kissing, no talking, no looking at each other (we normally include all of the above). \\n\\nIt was a really nice emotional release.\\n\\nAnd afterwards everything was better... because, sex. This is PIV only. About 350 times across 6 months in 2013 with the same partner.\\n\\nIn my lifetime? I\\'ve had sex maybe 20 times before that.\\n\\nI\\'ve had sex 9 times this year according to our spreadsheet. Hi Matt,\\n\\nJudging by your post\\'s strange title with its unnecessary inclusion of your name, it seems like one of your friends has gained access to your reddit account. I would recommend finding funnier friends. \"Hahaha let\\'s make Matt gay\" is so 90\\'s. im 22 and getting one i hate when people give the speech on changing our mind besides this guy seems dead set\\n Same goes for females....I had the unfortunate experience of going down on my ex girlfriend back when we were together at 11pm, and she had not showered since the night before. ;_;\\n\\n\\nThat was the first time I had stop before a female orgasmed. It\\'s not just guys.  I am a woman, in a happy committed relationship, and I also watch porn.\\n\\nAs long as watching porn isn\\'t causing your SO to ignore your needs sexually, or he skips work to watch porn, or something else destructive, why is it a problem?  If my boyfriend was some guy I didn\\'t know in a movie and he took his shirt off, I wouldn\\'t be impressed and I wouldn\\'t be drooling over the sight of his bare chest.\\n\\nI feel terrible typing that. \\n\\nBut I shouldn\\'t, dammit, because my boyfriend is not some guy in a movie that I don\\'t know. He takes his shirt off and I\\'m excited because I\\'m thinking about how amazing his skin feels against mine. I love every inch of his body because that\\'s the one body on this earth I am daily so intimate with, the one I trust to take me on incredible sexual adventures. When he takes his shirt off before we have sex I\\'m just straight up turned on by the sight, because naked him + naked me = pleasure and intimacy and fun ahead.\\n\\nI have so much more invested in his body than simple eye candy. My boyfriend liked casual sex because his major turn on is pleasuring women. So it was just lots of fun for him, but not an emotional experience.\\n\\nI\\'ve had two casual sexual relationships, and yeah, it doesn\\'t do much for me. It\\'s been years so maybe I\\'ve changed... but my enjoyment of sex has thus far relied on feeling safe, secure, sexy, wanted and loved. \\n\\nAlso - there\\'s a lot to be said for quickies. No time for monotony!! I definitely understand this point and understand but this is exactly why I personally could never participate in a threesome. I\\'d rather focus on my partner individually and would want the same intense attention. I know I would simply objectify a third person and that\\'s not right.  I think you\\'ve overdosed on that Red Pill, dude. Teasing outside of sex can increase the desire for it. Part of it is her ability to relax too. Try non-sexual relaxing activities like a massage or a bath, and then move to foreplay. It\\'s a lot of work to get started, but  doing this sometimes could help. Good sex requires relaxation and letting go of everything, which can be very hard for some people. There\\'s not being a doormat, and then there\\'s \"she owes me sex because I did this and that\". No. Nobody owes you sex. If someone really wants to withhold sex in a relationship, they can - bear in mind though that this doesn\\'t make them immune to any consequences (break-ups, etc...they can\\'t expect to not compromise and keep a relationship exactly as they want). When you say someone owes you sex, that\\'s pretty much rape if they don\\'t want it.\\n\\nAlso, the alpha and beta talk stinks of the red pill and half-arsed evolutionary theories. You\\'ve gone hardcore beta mode on this girl. No sex, massages every night, and you pay for almost everything...you hear that OP? It\\'s the sound of a whip cracking. Pull out of this relationship and get your manhood back. It sounds like she\\'s lost respect for you and doesn\\'t see you in a sexual manor and I doubt she ever will I think it\\'s a bit of both, she has no respect for him because he allows himself to be neglected this way, but she also has no interest in ever having sex with him and feels he will not make her change her ways. enough reading on /r/deadbedrooms and I don\\'t believe OP\\'s girlfriend will ever want sex. I just think he should leave it\\'s pretty clear that she has no interest in sex, whether it\\'s due to his behavior or her lack of interest, I don\\'t think it\\'s a fixable problem. How is making her equally responsible for her lot in their relationship pushing her away? How is not being a doormat for her a bad thing? She\\'ll be pissed but he really needs to step up and and stand up for what he wants in his relationship and kissing her ass isn\\'t going to get him that. How do you know where the problem stems? And what exactly is happening since what he is currently doing clearly isn\\'t working?\\n\\n That\\'s what I\\'m saying there - I may have worded it badly (I\\'m on a tablet, typing is physically painful) but there is an unspoken agreement in marriage to have sex, and I fully support and encourage that. However, if one party wants to withhold sex, they are fully within their rights to in a normal marriage. However, there are consequences that come with this (the emotional discontent, break-ups, distress,  etc) that they cannot be considered immune to.\\n\\nIn a probably terrible analogy, it\\'d be like going out in public and punching someone in the face. Maybe I enjoy it, maybe I don\\'t like not punching people, whatever, but I\\'m almost definitely going to face some consequences for it, so it isn\\'t really a recommended course of action or a nice thing to do.\\n\\nSo yeah, I definitely agree with your point. Entering a marriage, there\\'s an agreement to have sex, like there\\'s a law to stop people punching others in the face. You can break it if you really want, but it\\'s a terrible idea and there\\'s gonna be consequences. I personally just don\\'t enjoy latex, my wife hates the smell too. Lifestyles skin is awesome, I just like their brand in general I agree. That isn\\'t rape. As I said with the previous guy, I\\'m on a tablet so probably explained badly, but I meant actually forcing someone who does not want sex to have sex, physically or otherwise. Your SO consents and since I assume you both enjoy it, definitely not rape, so have at it :) Definitely not where OP lives that\\'s for sure Radiohead. The music is meant for sex.\\n\\nIf not Radiohead, then Oasis. Try all the positions from Kamasutra. ALL. (: I agree with the other posters that said, \"It\\'s supposed to be unpredictable.\" (paraphrased)  That\\'s what\\'s so thrilling about it!  If she is the one in control, she could squeeze you to restrict or slow down the process.  That\\'s about all I got though. Not married and no kids?  Kick her out and find another woman who will treat you well.  She more than likely is fu¢king someone else and that is why she isn\\'t after you. Here\\'s a few things that my wife and I tried (with success):\\n\\n* Shower together, not just occasionally -- every day.  NOTE: This is not about having sex in the shower, but building intimacy and feeling close.  Being washed can be quite titillating, though, and is quite nice!\\n\\n* Be concerned about one another.  For instance, if my wife works out, or is on her feet all day, I\\'ll *tell her* to give me her feet so I can massage them for a while.  This usually happens on the couch while watching some TV.\\n\\n* If you have confidence issues, what better way to alleviate the nervousness than to give her no-strings-attached pleasure?  Touch her, tease her, practice pleasing her.  Make sure to ask for feedback, and adjust accordingly.  Record her commentary in your mind for future reference.\\n\\n* Ask if she has any interest in non-vanilla activities.  Many women are interested in having a dominant partner, is your wife?  If so, explore the idea with her, even if you aren\\'t that interested.  You may find something you like that you dismissed before.\\n\\nThe critical thing is to *keep trying*.  Try subtle things.  Ask yourself, \"How is she feeling? What little thing can I do to make her day better?\" I know it\\'s cliché, but I started putting notes in my wife\\'s lunch.  Sometimes sexy, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes just a profound quote or memory.\\n\\nAbove all, ask for feedback and communicate.  Encourage her to join in your search for intimacy.  Share things that you would love, use sentences like \"I think it would be great to do X\" or \"I always wondered what it would be like to Y\".  Yes they\\'re hints, and no they aren\\'t very subtle, but if you promise to listen to each other you can start to build a stronger bridge between the two of you. The other posters nailed the confidence thing.  That\\'s how to be the sexiest.  Don\\'t be wishy-washy, *know what you want*.  In fact, it may help to create a scene in your head.  The very definition of seduce includes the wording \"have one\\'s way with\".  So, what is your \"way\"?\\n\\nIf you want an idea, I would recommend some give and take.  Be scantily dressed, kiss and touch him to get him worked up.  Sternly guide him to perform oral on you (or something else of your preference), and afterwards finish him off with your mouth.  Once you have a plan, if you can be bold enough to say explicitly with words what is about to happen (a play-by-play) without laughing, that will stoke his fire too.\\n\\nStandard disclaimer: Every one is different, your mileage may vary, etc. Pills are foreign hormones to her body. An IUD is copper (non-hormone) or a low hormone dosage, which is effectively the same as taking a pill. Except it\\'s more reliable since you do not forget to take it everyday at exactly the same time. Religion? Sounds like a bullshit excuse because she\\'d afraid. Condoms don\\'t feel good for either party, but I am doubtful she\\'s truly open to alternate methods. Here is my perspective about the viewing of porn in a relationship:\\n\\nIf you are dissatisfied with the amount of sex you are having (too little), and he\\'s watching porn in place of having real-life sex with you -- it\\'s a problem.  If you\\'re happy or content with the amount and he\\'s watching porn frequently, *he isn\\'t happy with the amount*.  That could be wrong though, maybe he *is content* but his natural interest in seeing and learning about all things sex is unsatisfied.  It is also entirely possible that your partner is addicted to porn, where he is literally using every chance afforded to him to watch it.\\n\\nHe may have some kinks or things he\\'s interested in, but doesn\\'t feel comfortable enough to share those with you yet.  If you seem really sensitive, conservative, or upset by his porn watching habits -- I can almost guarantee that he does not feel *safe enough* to openly share his feelings or perspective with you.\\n\\nTL;DR: Don\\'t fear porn because you don\\'t understand your boyfriend\\'s motivation to watch it.  Communicate and be less judgmental to get a glimpse into his mind so that he can open up about it. I usually attribute this to technique.  If she\\'s using the right amount of pressure and has her hands wrapped around the right end of it, good things will happen.  Of course, speed is important.  Listen to your body, and be comfortable enough to give her gentle instruction.  (e.g. Squeeze a little more, go a little faster, or guide her hand to the best position)\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to teach her what works for you.  Also, discuss how she will handle *the climax*.  If I were a betting man, I\\'d say you might be worried about how she\\'ll react when the time comes. I know your intentions are good when you say you want to *surprise him*, but think about this for a second... Would you want to be surprised with a stranger?  Just because he wants the threesome does not mean *just anyone with a vagina will do*.  He really needs to be part of the decision.  You could screen for people without his knowledge, and if anyone promising shows up, introduce them.  See where it goes from there.  Also, don\\'t forget there is a lot of little details that all of the involved parties should go over.  Even though she may not be welcome as a long-term partner, she is a person and has feelings too.  She is probably not someone to be used and thrown away (unless you are paying for her services). Not sure why you were down voted for stating a preference in a thread about the appearance of the genitals. Yeah I feel like we got the short end end of the stick when it comes to toys though, because it\\'s much easier to make a protuberance for women than it is to make an accurately-heated wet hole with pressure sensation for men. Now see, I spend a great deal of time on this subreddit trying to convince women that they shouldn\\'t fear porn and you throw out some fear-inducing post like this? (Before I answer, this is not a normal reaction to watching porn, ladies!)\\n\\nYou sound passive-aggressive.  Like, what is it that you and your girlfriend aren\\'t doing to make you happy?  Whatever it is, tell her about it, and make things better!  Don\\'t sit in your chair jerking it to porn, stewing over some kink that isn\\'t being fulfilled. HIS BUTT.\\n\\nAlso eyes.  And height.  And shoulders.\\n\\nFacial hair is also a plus. Muscly arms, but they don\\'t have to be that big. If I\\'m at a gig and other girls are swooning over the lead singer, I\\'ll usually just be staring at the drummer. get ready to do laundry. Paying for sex is a hell of a lot better than getting a girl drunk to have her sleep with you imo. Not that I\\'d do either, but you know - just my two cents on it. I would be fine with a girl having condoms on her. Unless I have a hot date I\\'m usually ill prepared so if surprise sex happens where I didn\\'t expect it, I would rather she had some than neither of us. Damn the next time I\\'m shopping for some high quality luxurious butt plugs I know who to talk to haha [We\\'re talking about these](http://www.skyncondoms.com/us/what-is-skyn-condoms) Those are super cheap... but the bad reviews about them breaking a lot are discouraging. I\\'d rather spend a couple more bucks to *not* have a baby. Sounds like you\\'re a one woman guy with a multiple-woman kinda girl.\\nPersonally, it sounds more like envy than jealousy.  Your g/f is having a \"whirlwind sex life with a bunch of cute girls while I\\'m at home catching up on my reading.\"  \\n\\nSome part of you wants his g/f\\'s life. wayyyyy over thinking this. Does the pizza man care how hungry you are if you ordered a pizza? no he just cares gettin you the pizza. well go get it then yo. he got that special cheese for you he wants to get paid so he wants to get me my pizza. i dnt get my pizza he gets in hot water. I dont give a fuck how he feels about me or my pizza just as long as it get there. id say just let people know who you are going to be \"with\" its different but its not a big problem. your life will be different but you can make the best of it by finding a person who does not care. WHat do you want in your life? a sex life with this person or a partner that is reliable. You can have both with a new person.\\n\\nId say leave her/ what she gonna really do.\\n\\nIts good that she wants to learn which is amazing. why not work with that. Get slowly show her how well life can be when shes not so flakey. that girl is mistaken and silly. thats like someone telling you pizza is not a food. um yeah it is. she might not like it but shit tons of people do. She most likely is just a hater or shes trying to be a bitch. anything but a close up of a vagina or a mouth. thats not hot to me. Even if I thought my boyfriend was the hottest guy on the planet right now, he won\\'t be young forever. He\\'d never be able to maintain that title. It\\'s pointless shooting for it. I think he\\'d pretty damn satisfied with his place in my life - he just has to whisper in my ear and I completely melt, he turns me on like nothing else, he makes me laugh, he\\'s absolutely my best friend and my favourite person and just, ugh, I love the guy. \\n\\nIf your partner\\'s porn use is interfering with your sex life... if he turns down sex in order to masturbate, if he insults your body, if he doesn\\'t make you feel sexy and loved... then that\\'s a problem. I think people are turned on by attractive people and people find youth attractive.\\n\\nI\\'m curious as to why you asked the question? Haven\\'t seen this yet, so how about \"not everything.\" If that makes sense, what I mean is it\\'s great to see someone naked, better to be tantalized by the prospect of seeing them naked before you actually see it. Cover stuff up strategically so that the person looking wants more. Do this in a few different ways before going all out. That\\'d be pretty neat. &gt;I plan on marrying this man, regardless of our current sex life. I couldn\\'t see myself being with anyone else. We are so good together in pretty much every other aspect, that our sex life alone could not deter me from him.\\n\\nYou can always tell when the most desperate and sad stories are going to come out when the poster starts this defensive.\\n\\nOP, you\\'ve described a tremendously selfish and immature man who has reduced you to a set of tits for his use as a fetish object. *How can you pretend this does not speak volumes about him?* Saying \"but he\\'s a really nice guy otherwise\" is like saying \"it\\'s a great car except that it doesn\\'t have brakes.\"\\n\\nYou have a kid with him, I get it. Sunk costs are here in force. But there is no way, *no way* that this behaviour is going to be tolerable for the rest of your natural life. And I think you know it, which is why you started off so strident: we save the best lies for ourselves, so reiterating your absolute commitment is part of trying to convince yourself, via convincing readers of your thread. If you can make everyone accept that this situation is one you can and will live with, it\\'d be easier to accept it yourself.\\n\\nI just don\\'t think it\\'s rational or ...frickin *humane* to condemn yourself to this for life. I suggest that solving this issue (or determining whether it is solvable -- because after all a \"fetish\" means for that him, arousal this way is a definite *requirement* of sex, not a bonus) through intensive counselling should be an absolute prerequisite to your going through with the marriage. Otherwise you have two potential futures: the one where you cheat with the first man who treats you as a whole sexual being with (wonderful, enjoyable) needs and a delicious pussy, or the one where your soul slowly withers into nothing until your boobs get too saggy and he exchanges you for a newer model (or just commits himself fully to porn).\\n\\nHonestly, you\\'re at a crossroads. I really hope you value yourself enough to give your sex life, and your right to be treated as a full human being in the bedroom, full weight in your decision which way to turn. Three questions:\\n\\n1. How long have you been married?\\n2. How long has this situation been going on? Has it always been this way, or is it more recent?\\n3. Has your appearance changed significantly since you got married? (Weight gain, for instance). You are a generous, caring person, and I want to acknowledge that even as you have been describing your frustrations you have taken every effort to defend and support your fiance as a whole person. I don\\'t think he\\'s a villain, I just think you may be fundamentally sexually incompatible. That doesn\\'t make him evil and no one is coming after him with pitchforks, but it\\'s also not a small or unworthy issue. Sex is like air -- if you\\'ve got plenty of it and it\\'s good, you don\\'t even notice it, but if it\\'s polluted or being cut off, *it is all that matters*.\\n\\nOn top of your desire to not to reduce your fiance to a villain, I also think you may have some fear-based thinking: basically, \"I\\'d be a single mother, and I can\\'t do better.\" That\\'s one of those toxic assumptions that, when you base decisions on it, spirals into further and further entrenchment because the initial basis that drove your decisions was flawed.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if it is a male/female thing, or just the unique combination of your two personalities, but there is a distinct people-pleaser pattern here. If your fiance treated you with a fraction of the consideration with which you treat him there would be nothing to post about. You\\'re worried about his stress: what about yours? You\\'re worried about his arousal: what about yours? You\\'re worried about his needs: what about yours? You\\'re (perhaps) worried about whether you can do better: why isn\\'t *he* counting his lucky stars that he has someone in his life that has entertained his fetish at all, let alone to this extent? Why doesn\\'t that motivate him to reciprocate? Etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s important. *You\\'re* important. Self-sacrifice is a short-term solution. If you ignore this or dismiss it, you\\'d be cheating not only yourself, but him, because you\\'re living a lie for his benefit and it just can\\'t last.\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth, I don\\'t consider counselling a wastebasket suggestion to be thrown at everyone. I count my excellent marriage counselling experiences as a large contributor to my day-to-day and overall happiness. I really hope you have some breakthroughs if you pursue this.\\n\\nETA - \\n\\n&gt;I\\'m afraid he\\'ll get angry that I\\'ve resorted to reddit for advice on our relationship.\\n\\nI guess he could get angry. I\\'m assuming that his anger is unpleasant, but not frightening or dangerous -- please indicate if this is not the case?\\n\\nAnger isn\\'t inherently bad, it\\'s just a feeling. If I were you I\\'d be experiencing a LOT of it, so I don\\'t judge it. Don\\'t let his desire to maintain the status quo be a cage that prevents you from moving or stretching. Remember -- *he is perfectly satisfied*. Everything you\\'re asking for, he\\'s likely going to resist (which also says a lot about him). But just being mad about it should not be enough to stop you. fMRI and MRI are different. Totally puzzling, I don\\'t blame you for being frustrated in the least -- while still suggesting gently that finding someone (particularly you, the largely injured party) \"at fault\" for what might be a simply inherent mismatch is counterproductive and unnecessary.\\n\\nHaving neutral guidance through these issues would be so enlightening, I think. Because the problem with talking about highly intimate subjects is that there\\'s so many layers of feelings and assumptions and communication styles between the person, the questions, the answers, and the \"truth\" that derailment is an almost certainty until a skilled facilitator puts you on the right track and trains you in a new way of relating to one another.\\n\\nOh, and from one mother (two older kids, third on the way) to another, your nap/laundry value placement is right on the money! Infants are more than a full time job, because even if you\\'re not actively wiping a butt, you *never* go off shift of awareness and attention unless you can actively hand it off to another trusted adult. We call it \"24/7 suicide watch\" and given the level of responsibility, I don\\'t think that\\'s inaccurate at all! So true. The sex toy industry has been flooded with cheap crap, which is fine with a simple vibrator, but an ass is a lot less tolerant haha As far as I know, the main thing you have to watch for is semen going into the bladder, but I think that\\'s mostly a risk when you stop the semen while it\\'s in the guy\\'s penis, not if you stop it earlier than that. She sounds weird and manipulative. I doubt even her knows what she wants. I mean what does she expect, for you to lose your virginity with someone else then come back to her? I\\'m pretty sure that would piss her off.\\n\\nPlus, having to teach you everything... She probably will need to teach every guy she\\'s ever with how she works personally, because some things do it for someone and not for someone else. If she expects non-virgins to immediately know what feels good for her the first time they have sex, she\\'s in for a surprise.\\n\\nIt seems to me she\\'s just looking for an excuse not to have sex with you. Possibly for an excuse to have sex with other people (she keeps complaining about the lack of sex after all and how much she want it). Unless you\\'re ready for more of that, you should break up, explain you\\'re not compatible, and find someone who won\\'t have her shitty attitude. At least tell him you have nightmares in which he\\'s hurting you. Then tell him you don\\'t want to share details if you want, he should be able to understand that, but he needs to know he\\'s done nothing wrong.\\n\\nAs for your problem, well I think your nightmares must come from the fact that you feel bad about your fantasy, and so your brain is, in a way, punishing you by showing you how much you\\'d hate it if it happened for real.\\n\\nBut of course you would. That\\'s why it\\'s a fantasy. And I\\'m not sure exactly how you can come to terms with the fact that it\\'s okay to fantasize about non-consent... It\\'s not hurting anyone. It\\'s not disrespectful to any real victims and it does not mean you deserve anything bad to happen to you.\\n\\nIf you want to introduce it to the bedroom, start small. For instance when he\\'s on top of you, ask if he could hold your hands and not let go. The first time just stay like that. Another time tell him you want to struggle a bit but he shouldn\\'t let go, that if you want him to stop holding you, you\\'ll actually tell him.\\n\\nAnd so on, little by little, introduce a little bit of it. See what happens with your dreams. It\\'s possible that once you\\'ll fulfill your fantasy the dreams will slow down or stop, but it could also make them worse. Play it by ear.\\n\\nFind forums and other communities of people with that same kink. Maybe you feel guilty because you think your partner wouldn\\'t be into it and don\\'t want to force him to do it. And after all, your fantasy is of him forcing you, not the other way around, so maybe just the idea of having to introduce the idea to him, rather than him coming up with it, seems less sexy?\\n\\nBut you do need to communicate. He must be worried about you and it would be a weight off your chest.\\n\\nNow, the last issue is how you withdraw from him after such a dream. You know it\\'s not rational but can\\'t help feel that way. Try and remind yourself over and over again that him in your dreams is still you. Everyone in your dreams is you. Everything is your own brain. Nothing he does in your dreams is caused by him, it\\'s just the way you process information at night. And maybe you dream of it because you want it to happen, but you freak out because in the dreams it\\'s actually rape and not a fantasy.\\n\\nNow, don\\'t force it if it makes you feel worse, but the next time you have that nightmare, and wake up in bed next to him, I think it might help if you hugged him for comfort. Touch can be very powerful and it\\'s possible to \"forgive\" someone just through hugging them. Maybe if you manage to do that, you won\\'t feel the need to withdraw anymore.\\n\\nOf course, if it makes you feel worse, then stop, take your distance, and tell him what happened (\"I had a dream in which you hurt me... I\\'ve been having these... I know you never would and I\\'m sorry for being distant but the dreams kind of mess me up.\")\\n\\nThen maybe you can find a way for you to feel better, together. Maybe hugging something else (a pet, a plush toy, etc). At any rate, you should know that if you ever try your fantasies with him, and you ever ask him to stop, he will (the way you described him, at least. I obviously don\\'t know the guy). So what happens in the dreams wouldn\\'t actually happen.\\n\\nIf it only gets worse, I would suggest a sex therapist. They\\'re trained to help with these kinds of problems, and considering how hard it seems to make your life and your relationship, I think it would definitely be worth it. A blood test will diagnose whether she\\'s pregnant or not. It\\'s rare but some people do not test positive on a pee stick so she should have blood work done for a definitive answer.\\n\\nEither way she should have her hormones checked. 3 months without a period is cause for concern. She seems to know what she wants/needs in the bedroom... but what about your wants and needs? Being in a relationship means trying to please each other. Have you tried talking to her about it, and what does she say?\\n\\nYou could alternate sessions to her liking and sessions to your liking. Or does she have a \"it\\'s that, or no sex\" kind of attitude? If so, I agree it might be time to move on. Your relationship doesn\\'t sound very fulfilling and quite honestly, unless the changes are due to big personal problems on her end that have nothing to do with you, to me it sounds like they\\'re a result of the relationship not really working anymore. I should hope it only happens with him. They\\'re married. \\n\\nEdit: Im such a prude.  I find that my guy likes reverse best and that I have better control while leaning forward in this position. If you\\'re having issues with rhythm control or moving fast enough to get him off, try riding him while crouching rather than resting on your knees. The advantage to this is the bouncing motion which you can use to your advantage. I think knowing there is an issue is the main part. Next relationship, you can see what your partner wants and likes and adapt.\\n\\nI don\\'t think stating what you want is as bad as never stating it and then breaking up because it never happened (as she seems to have done), but it\\'s true it\\'s not right to constantly ask for things and never offer to reciprocate.\\n\\nAbout giving oral sex, if you don\\'t want to be bored by it, have you considered 69ing? This way you\\'ll get a distraction of your own.\\n\\nOtherwise, if you\\'re eating a woman out and getting tired of it, you can always offer to switch to something else. Fingering, or intercourse, or intercourse while you rub her clit, whatever works for you guys. Sex doesn\\'t have to be about doing one thing until climax happens. You can absolutely switch it out!\\n\\nAnd don\\'t put too much pressure on her coming. If she enjoyed herself and is fine and happy, then take that as an answer. Sometimes a woman won\\'t be able to come, but if you refuse to stop until she does it will just mean pressuring her, and her odds of having a good orgasm will decrease by the second.\\n\\nSo as you said, better to do things for the present enjoyment. Lick her because she likes is, not because you see it as an investment for a payoff (her orgasm) that might come soon, late or not at all.\\n\\nAs for fingering, just like oral sex, it requires communication. Not 2 women are exactly the same, so be willing to adapt and learn for every new partner. And the same person might require different stimulation from one time to the next so the best advice really i: be flexible and adaptable. Do not watch a howto then follow it religiously every single time regardless of the situation. Getting ideas is good, but then adapt depending on her reaction, and communicate a lot. You\\'d be surprised by how many women don\\'t understand their own anatomy.  A piece of advice would be, while you\\'re learning to dominate her, don\\'t ask her things in an insecure manner.\\n\\nYou need her feedback, yes. But make her give it to you. Tell her things.\\n\\nSo for instance, with the safeword, letting her come up with it? Tell her to pick a safeword. Make it her homework. Then if you\\'re gagging her? Tell her how she will express a \"slow down\" or \"stop\" (shaking her head, tapping you on the shoulder, whatever you come up with). Say it matter-of-factly, because you have authority on her and won\\'t be questioned.\\n\\nIt\\'s about confidence. You want her feedback, but you don\\'t want to sound like you\"re asking \"am I doing it okay?\" as it breaks the fantasy. So instead, ask more assertive questions. For instance: \"does it hurt?\"\\n\\nAnd when she answers a question, go \"good girl\". It\\'s important that she doesn\\'t fear giving the \"wrong answer\". The truth is always the right answer. If she\\'s hurting and it\\'s not part of the fantasy, stop whatever is hurting, loosen her ties, whatever.\\n\\nJust avoid hesitating. Tell her what you\\'re going to do to her, then do it. Make sure she has the option to stop you if it\\'s too much for her.\\n\\nWhenever it\\'s over, take care of her, tell her she\\'s been very good, hug her, kiss her, etc. Being submissive can sometimes be hard on someone at first, if they end up in the \"sub zone\" they might really crave appreciation or feel used, so make sure you tell her she\\'s been great.\\n\\nAnd remember what makes you the dom isn\\'t the specific acts, but who\\'s in control. Oral sex for instance, you can tell her to suck your cock, or tell her to sit on your face. Either way, you\\'re the one who\\'s dominant, whether you\\'re giving or receiving, because you\\'re the one in control. Its not. You just hear about it more because vaginal is nearly a given.  I happen to enjoy lapdance for one song Interesting.\\n\\nWhat about him? Has *he* gained a lot of weight since you first started dating? If so, he might be less comfortable being naked around you, especially since you\\'ve gotten more fit. My ex loved it. I should call her. Touché! It isn\\'t pee. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_ejaculation) (nsfw) and info on [Skene\\'s gland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene\\'s_gland) will pretty much cover it all for you. Basically, scientists think that Skene\\'s gland is responsible for it, and \"Skene\\'s glands have highly variable anatomy, and in some extreme cases they appear to be absent entirely. If Skene\\'s glands are the cause of female ejaculation and G-Spot-orgasms, this may explain the absence in many women.\" Read up, squirting is fun! :) Bro, that\\'s not helping at all. C\\'mon. You\\'re fun, let\\'s party! I would leave her if I were you. She sounds very insensitive. &gt; Only ever happens with him, though\\n\\nSo, not with your boyfriends? &gt; It turns me on when I know I am in control of her getting off.\\n\\nSo then it\\'s a win-win. She\\'s telling you that she wants you to \"use her\" to get off because that, in turn, gets her off. She wants you to focus on what you want. \\n\\nI\\'ve dated many girls who are the same way and it\\'s great! I have a feeling she wants you to physically control the situation. Don\\'t ask her for a blow job. Say \"I want you to suck my cock\" and then when she goes for it stop her and say \"but not yet\". First I want to fuck you. Then physically move her into position and go for it. Lead the whole thing by deciding the positions and physically controlling her. Continue this type of physically and mentally dominating behavior and try to stay in \"character\".\\n\\nYou should really think of this as indulging yourself. If you want to do it...do it. Want her to sit on your face? Tell her to. Don\\'t think of what she wants outside of \"being dominated\". It\\'ll be more real that way. Slowly push the boundaries of what you want and she\\'ll let you know when you\\'ve reached her threshold of comfort. Just really enjoy yourself and be receptive to her actions. In the mean time, hold off your orgasm until she gets off at least once. From my experience the submissive types can end up coming many, many times during one session, but try to finish the affair with your own climax.\\n\\nAfter it\\'s over, do the cuddling, loving thing (assuming she\\'s into that). Thank her for trusting you to do that stuff and kiss her whole body. She\\'ll be counting the minutes until the next romp.\\n\\nGood luck. I don\\'t actually know, but isn\\'t the main difference about how long it takes to snap the shot? If it takes a 12 second exposure in a normal MRI, then that can\\'t be true of an fMRI that snaps progressive electrical states overt much shorter time periods. I don\\'t see why the subject matter if the image would be of import, and whether it\\'s moving or not. Okay I\\'m not going to do that. Mmm, frankly, they\\'re in their own home, so they\\'re allowed to do whatever they want.  I\\'d be offended if someone told me to quiet down in that case.\\n\\nThat said, if you\\'re friendly with them, just be straight forward next time you see them:  \"Hey guys, sorry if this is awkward, but we have super thin walls, and we can totally hear you guys having sex.  Would you mind trying to keep it down a little?\" If she\\'s not willing to be your first, You should not be willing to let her be your first. Don\\'t care if she\\'s 10/10. i\\'m a guy, and I know more about the female anatomy than basically every girl i\\'ve talked to Performance anxiety is very common on a first time. Basically, the more you stress out about not getting it up, the less you can get it up.\\n\\nWhat you can do differently next time is just assuming you won\\'t get hard, and not try to get yourself hard. You can still receive oral, don\\'t need to be hard for that, but focus on her for the most part. Then you might realise you got hard in the process. And if you don\\'t, how well. Try to relax about it and not expect to get hard.\\n\\nI know it must sound crazy, or even more stressful, but that\\'s the way it works. I\\'ve helped a lot of guys who had the same problem. And every time, once they relaxed enough and stopped thinking \"I need to get hard for it to be \\'successful sex\\'\" (whatever that means), they had no problem anymore.\\n\\nPorn is not very likely to be a culprit, but if you want, you can go without ejaculation (you can still touch yourself, just don\\'t come) for a few days to a week. That should get you way hornier, and it might help. However if you do that, be aware that you\\'re likely to come right away, possibly even before penetration occurs, especially since you say you come really fast through lapdances.\\n\\nBut once you\\'ve managed to be hard once, you\\'ll probably relax enough that you won\\'t need any \"tricks\". Just don\\'t put too much pressure on yourself, I assure you, you don\\'t need a hard cock to please your partner. As for your penis size, almost all guys think they\\'re tiny, but only a small minority are. You might be average or even bigger than average. And even if you are smaller, size isn\\'t that important... Most women get off with a finger which isn\\'t very thick, and the sensitive area of the vagina is right at the opening, so length isn\\'t required either.\\n\\nHell, even penetration isn\\'t required, so you\\'d be fine without a cock at all. So don\\'t fret about size, I know people make it sound like it\\'s a huge deal, but it really isn\\'t unless you\\'re really extreme one way or the other (for instance so big that even with tons of lube, you\\'re hurting your partner and therefore can\\'t have any penetrative sex). New York abstains courteously. Come on guys. I know you\\'re joking, you know you\\'re joking, but this could look serious. \\n\\nDon\\'t cheat on your girlfriend. Break up with her first. \\n\\nEdit: You guys can not seriously be this fucking childish? Have none of you ever been cheated on? Yeah, what she did was shitty, but you don\\'t use sex as a weapon. You grow some fucking balls, tell her she\\'s an idiotic twat, and you drop her. Don\\'t fucking cheat on people you lowlife shit heads.  You really need to rethink the relationship, this doesn\\'t seem healthy. What does the fox say? No, she doesn\\'t and you\\'re a colossal asshole for suggesting it.  But sex is like pizza ): &gt; First of all, I love my fiance. He is a wonderful man and we have a beautiful 3 month old son. I plan on marrying this man, regardless of our current sex life. I couldn\\'t see myself being with anyone else. We are so good together in pretty much every other aspect, that our sex life alone could not deter me from him.\\n\\nTurns out you can find other people with whom you will be \"so good together\" and who DON\\'T suck in bed. You are being [gaslighted](http://thecurrentconscience.com/blog/2011/09/12/a-message-to-women-from-a-man-you-are-not-%E2%80%9Ccrazy%E2%80%9D/). &gt; maybe there is something that I\\'m doing or not doing that makes him not care about me sexually? \\n\\nMaybe he\\'s just not a good person. Turns out there are a lot of those in the world.\\n\\nIt\\'s NOT YOUR FAULT. Yeah, I\\'m sorry. Thanks. I think that would be an asshole thing to do. Sure, have sex with someone else, but break up with her first. Cheating isn\\'t the answer, and whoever you have sex with shouldn\\'t be someone you use to prove a point to your girlfriend. That would be disrespectful to not just one, but two women. She\\'s either crazy or she\\'s cheating on you, or both.  Time to put your foot (and by that I mean your penis) down.  If she doesn\\'t want you, its\\' time to move on. My first sexual interactions actually consisted of blowing other guys, so yeah sure, I\\'d say I still find penises kind of attractive.\\n\\nNot nearly as much as boobs and female curves though. I *love* boobs. bout 99% of my sex yes. There was that one time where we just had not time for such things. Really no care for very much anything other then Fucking like crazy horny teens. We had not seen each other in id say a week or so and it was just on. Like there was no words just her bottoms came off and i unzipped and off we went. No foreplay needed. DAMN! Wow, I do the muscle clenching too! So I should try just relaxing totally? I try but... its hard. Depends who she sends the pics to! I don\\'t consider myself bisexual at all since I have no attraction to men. But I think dicks are pretty cool, and if I got a girl naked and found that she had one I\\'d be totally fine with that. \"Re... rem... remember the Alamo!\" I totally know what you mean, thats exactly what I do. At the moment only a vibrator (operated by me or my boyfriend) works, and it still takes ages :( Texas has already arrived, so I\\'ll just offer the follow-up of \"remember the a la mode\" as you smush ice cream on her. The odds that her vaginal discharge is of a healthy amount are very high. The amount (and color, smell, consistency etc etc) varies not only from woman to woman, but is also dependent on where she is in her menstrual cycle. There are women who have close to no discharge, but then again I\\'ve heard about people with so much discharge they actually have to wear panty liners on a daily basis. Most importantly, your girlfriend is the expert on what the normal amount of discharge is for her.\\n\\nFor her sake I really hope you didn\\'t tell her you\\'d prefer her to have less discharge, especially since you seem kind of young. It\\'d make me super self-conscious if my boyfriend was to tell me this. Hey, yah! Cuz why would you possibly support the expanded choice and control of others\\' sexual lives? It\\'s not like anyone did anything for you, is it? Speak for yourself. I an unable to have sex with them. &gt;It will also be interesting to see what the rates of male compliance are- as the article mentions women already often miss x3 pills in a month.  Men, being more risk tolerant and generally less compliant, may miss more.  Since male fertility is \\'always on\\' and not \\'maybe\\' like female fertility, this may be an issue depending on how the possible solution interacts with missing a dose.\\n\\nIt\\'s really freaking frustrating when people comment and clearly have not read the article. It\\'s not a pill, it\\'s a device, and it doesn\\'t have any scheduled maintenance. It\\'s a single injection good for 10 years.\\n\\nNot even to mention, all of your criticisms can be said about the pill for women, including the moral hazard argument (it\\'s happening right now with the morning after pill). Would you argue that these methods shouldn\\'t have been funded at all, then? No.\\n\\nQuit regurgitating Catholic propaganda and think for yourself a little, *after* actually doing the required reading.\\n\\n I have sex every day and I still masturbate several times a week. \\n\\nI\\'d be willing to abstain from masturbating as an experiment if my boyfriend asked me to, but I really don\\'t think it would have any effect on my sex drive. I think you should trust your girlfriend\\'s feelings on her own body. \\n\\nThe real issue here is that you\\'re not having sex as much as you would like. You need to be clear with your girlfriend about your emotional need for sex and work with her to find a solution. Yeah, that\\'s what I was thinking too. She\\'s getting pounded by a guy with a Mack truck between his legs and now Op\\'s equipment isn\\'t delivering the goods anymore for her.  Honestly, I\\'ve tried everything under the sun. It\\'s not just condoms, I have other sensitivity issues, so it might not matter at all, any barrier is too much barrier.\\n\\nBut I\\'m curious, so I\\'ll be in touch. This is a thread about building support for male birth control. Your comment comes across as \"fuck you, got mine\" in that context. &gt;  I don\\'t think she\\'s cheating on you, she\\'s grown apart from you and this is just a weak excuse\\n\\nShe may not even realize that the issue is she just feels grown apart from him. She may honest to god think it\\'s their sex life through recent encounters with him. A lot of people blame the sex life for what are actually emotional problems in a relationship and I think that unfortunately far too many realize it too late after the fact.\\n\\n &gt; women in their late 20\\'s are dying for a guy like you,\\n\\nAm above,  can confirm.\\n\\n I\\'m sorry and bring on the downvotes, but: Terrible advice.\\n\\nNot everyone reacts the same way when they are accused of something, especially something major. Some people flip out because they can\\'t believe you\\'d think of them that way, some laugh because they can\\'t believe you\\'d think of them that way, others give zero reaction due to confusion for you having thought of them that way.\\n\\nThere\\'s just no way to predict her reaction to this. I, personally, am not a fan of playing a game to find the truth, but I\\'d be a hypocrite if I said I hadn\\'t done it myself. I just don\\'t get the impression that she\\'s going to tell him the truth simply because he asked are acted as if he knew.\\n &gt; Theres absolutely nothing sexy in a woman\\'s eyes about desperate.\\n\\nActually, there\\'s *plenty* that\\'s sexy, admirable, and attractive about his obvious commitment to her. Certainly he\\'s clinging a bit because he\\'s frightened, but who the hell wouldn\\'t be when hit over the head with such bullshit?\\n\\nYou can call him desperate when the relationship has ended and he\\'s *still* trying to get her back. Until then, stop shooting the man while he\\'s already down.\\n\\n No shit. It\\'s really sad to see such shallow justifications for what is actually just a self defeating prophecy. You should probably read more than the title, then... Agreed. This has nothing to do with dick size. Especially if she isn\\'t a sexual person. She\\'s just looking for an out. Someone that can\\'t be honest like that is NOT what I would personally look for in a partner so my guess is, bullet dodged. &gt; It smelled as if she had ran, flat out, on a hot summer\\'s day for five whole miles. [...] The moral of the story [...]. Every single day. \\n\\nJust saying: After two hours in the kitchen (I\\'m assuming: prep. a warm meal; actual cooking involved) - followed by a sit-down meal for an hour or longer... (I also assume she wasn\\'t wearing a dress, but pants...): That very much does equal a five-mile run on a hot summer\\'s day. \\n\\nMaybe your implication that she hadn\\'t applied soap that day is true. And maybe it isn\\'t. Yeah, my impression is that it\\'s up to the guy to actually propose, but then the girl takes over and actually plans the wedding.\\n\\nAdmittedly, my experience is largely from movies and TV-shows, but this holds true for the 3 real-life weddings I attended. Might have to wait to try again.  I recommend not wording it as \"we need to have a *conversation*\", because that implies unhappiness, conflict, and confrontation.  Three things he is probably afraid to deal with.\\n\\nI think you would fare better if you asked \"to share some fantasies\" with him.  Basically, a friendlier invitation to discuss things of a sexual nature without any specific implication.\\n\\nIt seems as though he could use some comfort.  If he doesn\\'t like to discuss these things, consider sitting him down and at least expressing your *acceptance* of his fantasies (at least in the sense that you won\\'t judge him for them).  However, if a trans threesome is out of the question for you, then you should make that *very well-known*. Yeah one of the major side effects of BC is orgasm quality/ability.\\n\\nBack when that thread was posted about make BC, all the women were for it because then they wouldn\\'t have BC fucking up their sex drives.\\n\\nMaybe she should go off BC and wait a couple months to see if her orgasm ability returns. Your wording indicated that she *watches porn featuring those things*, which isn\\'t the same as her *fantasizing about doing it*.  I\\'m just saying.  And sometimes what makes porn so thrilling is it\\'s taboo nature.  In real life, she probably wouldn\\'t be into grandpa boning her. First off you really need to give your bum time to heal. There might not be any pain, or anything you can see but that does not necessarily mean that they are gone yet. It could be why it returned so easily now. \\n\\nGet some over the counter cream, apply it as directed and just let your bum be exit only for a while. If you\\'re going to continue doing it after this you really need to lay down your boundaries, \"surprise anal\" is not safe or fun and it needs to stop. Let us know how it all goes, too.  I\\'m rooting for you, man. We tried it early on in the relationship and it helped us communicate better about sex. My (now) husband says he was surprised by some of my answers as maybes to his yes\\'s. We talked about the things we both said no to too, and basically just used it as a discussion starter. After five years, it\\'s not about your penis.  She can\\'t or doesn\\'t want to articulate why she\\'s really leaving you.\\nIf you love her, cut her loose.  Let her find whatever she thinks it is that will make her happy.  Get some therapy and find a new love. You really need to get checked out by a doctor, the amount of blood you are describing is not right. It might just be scar tissue sure, but even if it\\'s not something dangerous you can\\'t keep on like that can you.  So, this sounds kind of like my situation (except the penis thing). 5 years into our relationship, my girlfriend decided that she didn\\'t want to live life never sleeping with anybody else. So, we have been in an open relationship (emotionally exclusive, sexually non-exclusive) for almost a year. It\\'s definitely a workable situation, but I don\\'t recommend it for all situations and all people. Still, it fixed the problems in our relationship and we are better than ever. It\\'s not your dick. It\\'s something else. Your girl is an immature child. It\\'s going to hurt a whole fuck of a lot for a long time, but you will be better off without her. Do not for one split fucking second ever doubt that your any less than anyone else. Move forward as fast as you comfortably can. If everything you said is true, this is not your fault. Fair sailing, man. wow. did she have a cut on her hand at all? you can go get tested if you want but i think your freaking for no reason. see there you go. Not everyone has something my friend. Trust me iv had some scares but its all good. Just to play devil\\'s advocate, I personally would only consider a MFM threesome if I were going to do one. I\\'m a lady. I just have no interest whatsoever in seeing my dude with another lady, nor do I have any desire towards women myself. But I could just be a weirdo. Upvote for poetry. Don\\'t rush it. It\\'s going to take some time to heal from this relationship, and you don\\'t want to rush into a rebound relationship.  hate to tell you this, but you are wrong on that. urine flushes out the system and resets it, there is no risk of sperm being left. if there was then I am sure it would be mentioned in the two sources. She cheated on you and doesn\\'t know how to handle it. I meant IRL, haha you don\\'t have to apologize over the computer Well put. Is it just me or is five years a really long engagement? No, they are incompatible. As bad as homosexuality according to the bible. Dump the Christian hypocrite or you\\'ll be dealing with the same inconsistently applied moral ideals for the rest of your life. Just be glad this came up now and not after the actual marriage. Sometimes people aren\\'t who we thought they were... She\\'s been cheating on you. Baby wipes clean up is a breeze She wants to fuck other guys, someone/people have probably told her about others\\' size/sexual prowess and she\\'s just wanting others... Dude leave the tramp alone and get the fuck away! A good blessing to come up pre-marriage. You have been together for over 5 years, and she is your fiance. This is unacceptable behavior. She won\\'t even talk to you about it, and is alluring that she is meeting up with people. And then the obsession with dick size, this makes me think she has cheated on you. In have a dick 2 inches above average, and is in no way a \"pencil dick\" Arghhh yes yes yes Do you have this only after sex? Maybe it\\'s just more noticeable then because of the situation you\\'re in and you\\'ve had an underlying problem (like mild IBS) and just never been aware. Wow. I bet your teeth felt like chalk after that. If I eat the lemon slice I get in a drink my teeth feel like they\\'re gonna crumble. That\\'s good advice. Often times any sort of anal stimulation is going to supplement other forms of stimulation. I can\\'t imagine that many people enjoy just rimming unless it\\'s a huge mental turn on which for many it is Yes. They work. If she isn\\'t complaining, you\\'re doing a good job.  If she\\'s comfortable enough to ask for what she wants, she will be comfortable enough to tell you if something is off. Show him this comment.  My wife finally mustered up the courage to let me know she ~~wanted~~ needed to be spanked.  I wasn\\'t turned on at the notion of spanking her, but once things began, I let some dominance take over and the sex has been amazing ever since.  I get what I want, I can tell she likes it when I *take what I want*, and she gets super wet from the spanking. The idea that you \"chose\" this guy doesn\\'t at all square with the rest of your claims, that this guy saved you from whatever, that you\\'re so terribly lucky to have anyone at all, etc. etc. If you really are in earnest I\\'m really sorry for your incredibly fucked up situation, but I\\'m having a harder and harder time believing it.  Those berry tablets are supposed to emphasize sweetness, not create it.  Lemons, spicy food, etc do still have some sugar in them, so the sweetness gets emphasized over the sour/bitter/spicy flavor.  You couldn\\'t really do it with bodily fluids because they are not sugary, so there\\'s nothing there to emphasize. It might sound weird, but buy a mouth-guard. You could always use a bit made of leather, or even a leather strap/belt.  Easier on the teeth and tougher than fabric.  Plus a little kinky and there is nothing wrong with that.\\n\\nNot as sexy, but easier to procure would be a mold-able mouth piece, can normally be found at larger drugstores, or sports stores.\\n\\nGood luck! Six     Gotta keep it going :D /u/MissFemme is correct.  Buying flowers and things are romantic gestures, sure, but it isn\\'t the same as a sensuous foot/back rub.  Initiate sex *slowly*.  So slowly that she will wonder if you\\'re even initiating.  Kiss that neck while she is doing dishes, but don\\'t go any further.  In other words, tease her slowly.  Imagine that her brain and body have about 20 little switches to flip, and once they are all turned on, she will be warmed up enough.  Remember, you have to turn on her mind as well as her body.\\n\\nKids can also take a mental toll, because it\\'s easy to fall into mom-mode or dad-mode.  The stress of kids can really knock a libido out of whack.\\n\\nJust remember these things:\\n\\n1. Get her to relax (this may take a while)\\n2. Turn her on slowly (if you\\'re penetrating 5 minutes in, you\\'re going to need to slow down).\\n\\nEveryone is different and your mileage may vary, but this is generally pretty good advice.   This just solidifies my conclusion, thanks.  I have a Remington bikini trimmer. It\\'s very good.\\n\\nOne charge does a few months. Its also waterproof so really easy to clean but I don\\'t recommend trying to use it on wet hair - too messy.\\n\\nIt does different length grades and has a foil attachment much like an electric shaver. Highly recommended. Sweet cum! Yaaay! ^^^^^wat Maybe the escorts in my area are just pricey, but I\\'ve found very few girls on backpage with rates that low. Plus most not-ghetto looking girls list that they\\'ll only take older men 35+. I\\'m in Connecticut, so maybe just the proximity to NYC and the Casinos on the other side of the state mean we have a lot more high end escorts than most places. God damn it, the west coast gets everything good. dr time Never, I\\'m just a poor college kid working part time minimum wage, so it\\'s all outside of my budget anyway. Most of them are down in the cities on the coast anyway, while I\\'m more inland near upstate NY and Mass a good hour or so away. It kind of depends upon the exact taste of the vagina. Keep in mind that the pills only work well to counteract sour tastes. I\\'m not an expert in the field, but I don\\'t think sour is quite the adjective used to describe most people\\'s genital taste. If it\\'s more of a bitter taste, the pills won\\'t do much. On a side note, you can eat a cut up lemon like an apple after having the pills and it will taste very sweet. I have a friend who was abused as a kid, and some of the things that happened to her are now in her \"kinkset\" as an adult. Not because she retroactively enjoyed them -- kind of the opposite: that she needed to consciously, personally *reclaim* those acts in a new context and with a trusted partner, to write over those bad memories with new, potent, positive ones. They are inherently charged because of her history, but they are made new again by her partner.\\n\\nI could see that being a factor with your husband, given his history, and I\\'m so impressed with both of you for muddling through a very tense and vulnerable emotional neighbourhood, and for your openness in working with him on these kinks. I can imagine that going through those old patterns and memories with a loving partner could be immensely healing for him (and hopefully rewarding for you).\\n\\nI also agree with the poster about how arousal/orgasm thoughts can be quite different from regular-brain thoughts, though I would admittedly also struggle with the \"wish you were a guy\" thing. The abuse information could really explain a lot about that, though, and I do hope you find a sex-positive counsellor to help you both successfully navigate these fraught waters. Take them in the best-lit room of your house.  If you have a camera and tripod, you\\'re almost set!  Take a lot, too, cherry pick the best ones.  If your camera has a self-timer, set it (for the highest delay possible that makes sense) and also set it to take multiple shots.  You should be able to set the camera so that it will wait 20-30 seconds before snapping the photos and then take 3-5 pictures in quick succession.\\n\\nThe main trick for great photos is to eliminate the need for a flash.  If the lighting is excellent, you should be able to turn the flash off and have nice sexy realistic photos.  If the lighting is bad, you might still be able to get some good photos if you turn up the ISO setting.  If your pictures have an orange or blue tint to them, you might need to set a lighting-type setting.  This will have options like \"Tungsten\", \"Fluorescent\", etc.  Tungsten is for bulbs that have a Tungsten filament (think old-styled bulbs, where the bright wire is visible while it\\'s lit).  Fluorescent is obviously for the newer style low-wattage bulbs or the long tube-style fluorescents.  This will fix the color weirdness.  As you switch rooms, you may need to keep changing this setting.\\n\\nMake sure there are no bright lights behind you, unless you\\'re using a flash, or want a silhouette-style photo.  If you\\'re taking super close-ups, make sure what you\\'re shooting is extremely well-lit and use the macro setting on your camera (usually a flower icon) -- don\\'t forget to turn Macro off when you\\'re done with the close-ups!\\n\\nYour camera\\'s quality will play a huge role in how well these turn out.\\n\\nEDIT: One final note, don\\'t be afraid to test out some locations in your house by shooting things that aren\\'t your naked body first.  For example, if you have a stuffed bear, stick it on the bed where you plan to lay and tinker with the settings until the photo starts looking good.  Then try it with you in the picture! This isn\\'t constructive or helpful. Good news!  If it\\'s his first, his expectations are not already set, and you will not be held to somebody else\\'s standard.  *How you do it is important, but the most important thing for this first time is to enjoy it and not take it too seriously.*  If he sees you having fun with it, he will feel more relaxed, and you both will feel better about the whole thing.  Also, you won\\'t be afraid to practice or get better in future sessions.  Don\\'t be shy to ask him if he likes what you\\'re doing. First and foremost, I\\'m sorry to hear that you\\'re having a difficult time with finding sexual happiness.  I do not think you\\'re alone, and there are plenty of women that would be more than happy to share information with you.\\n\\nI think there are two issues here.  The first is that you\\'re still feeling too insecure, perhaps from your past weight dilemma.  Any person that is filled with insecurity is going to have an impossible time trying to achieve orgasm.  The second is that you\\'ve *never* experienced orgasm.  Most women who finally break through that barrier have a much easier time getting there in future encounters.\\n\\nYou need a break!  You need a no-pressure, doesn\\'t-matter-what-I-look-like afternoon, with a soothing spa or shower and some sexual stimulation.  Don\\'t give up, but forget about the orgasm.  Do what feels good, if something doesn\\'t feel good, switch it up.  If it starts to *feel too good*, don\\'t be afraid, ride it out.\\n\\nTL;DR: Figure out your body first.  This will save your next candidate a lot of frustrating trial-and-error, and I assure you that there will be much less conflict if you can work through this task. &gt; Chocolate cake is great, but you sort of start to resent the cake because it doesn\\'t really have the nutrient you need.\\n\\nI just wanted to address this portion of your post.  Remember, you shouldn\\'t resent the sex -- you should resent the absence of whatever else it is you\\'re needing.  For him, sex is the thing he needs to feel intimate and really close to you.  If it\\'s not the same for you, you have to teach him how to provide what you need.  It is important to express satisfaction with the sex (if you are *indeed* satisfied with it), so that he understands that your needs are different than his, and that you aren\\'t criticizing his sexual abilities.\\n\\nAs many things as you have posted makes me think that moving in together might be jumping the gun a little bit, or that a therapist is still maybe a good idea.\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about unwanted vagina pains.  I would recommend cross-posting to /r/twoxsex though, so the ladies over there can chime in and give you some sisterly support.\\n\\nTL;DR: See a doctor about pain.  See a therapist about issues.  *Communicate!* It would be amazingly hot if my wife would just say: \"*I want you to eat my pussy now.*\"  I appreciate direct honesty.  Her desire and ~~want~~ need of it would fuel my desire to want to do it. Any woman that is direct enough to tell you that she *just likes to fuck sometimes*, is obviously interested.  If you think she\\'s safe, go for it. You did something nice for him, and I\\'m sure he has a fond memory of it.  It probably has not changed his opinion of you one bit.  If you had chemistry before, you probably still have it.  Call and work it out before traveling 800 miles though. Here\\'s a few suggestions:\\n\\n* Get yourself warmed up, maybe have a few orgasms on your own before he even joins in (this isn\\'t a long-term solution, but may make it easier for you to get some additional orgasms when he joins)\\n\\n* Try to work out a system for communicating during sex.  Discuss the system when you\\'re in the car driving somewhere, not immediately before or after sex.  An example would be, \"If what you\\'re doing is working *really* well, I will say \\'Yes!\\' often; if you hear me saying \\'Yes!\\' often do not speed up or change what you\\'re doing.\"  Something like that.\\n\\n* Make sure to ask him about some areas you could improve upon as well.  Remember, just because you aren\\'t happy, doesn\\'t mean that *he\\'s* happy.  He might be getting off, but maybe not in the way he would like, or maybe he doesn\\'t get to finish where he wants to.  Be prepared for some criticism you may not have been expecting.\\n\\nSometimes it\\'s good to have 1-way sex sessions.  Take turns.  On Monday, you will bring him to full orgasm without expecting anything in return.  Then on Tuesday, he should do the same for you.  If the receiver feels guilty or selfish afterwards, they can reciprocate. I don\\'t like to tell people to break-up, especially over an ED problem.  BUT, for a relationship to work, we have to understand and be able to cope with a person\\'s shortcomings.  Everyone can compromise to a certain degree on almost anything, but the fact that this is bothering you to the degree you\\'ve said here is overwhelming.  To allow yourself to stick around (with an inheritance in sight) seems morally wrong when you seem like you have one foot out the door over this issue.\\n\\nIf your post indicated at all that he was more committed to finding a solution (beyond a single therapy session), I would say you have hope, but I\\'m *not* seeing a light in this particular tunnel. Sounds like he needs to be gently coaxed into a wilder side.  I feel like my wife and I had this experience recently.  She told me she wanted to be *spanked*.  At first, I thought she was kidding.  There was no smile, however, on her face.  I raised a brow.  She was serious.\\n\\nI\\'d never spanked anyone before.  I wasn\\'t sure *how*.  I\\'ve never even entertained the notion of expressing dominance.  After I spanked her, and noticed how wet it made her, it\\'s almost all I can think about.  I fingered her to orgasm with her bent over my lap and her skirt hiked up.  After that, I pushed her down on her knees and made her suck me off.  Before I came, I told her that I was going to cum all over her pretty face.  She continued to suck me off, and when I told her I was cumming, she pulled me out of her mouth and I shot several loads on her face, one of which accidentally got in her eye.\\n\\nAfterwards, she told me how hot it was, and I realized that there must be something to this *dominant side* I was starting to develop.  After this, we talked about being honest with our needs, and it almost put all the pieces together.  She has been the happiest when I\\'m most in control and primal in nature.  This means being a little bit aggressive and taking what I want, and it turns her on immensely to see me this way.\\n\\nShare what I\\'ve posted here with your husband. diabetes matters; get help Haha well I don\\'t recommend selling your soul, but mmph! Nothing like marathon sex! I\\'m jealous :) Wow. Vanilla or not, that sounds hot. I\\'m a switch, so *sometimes* I like being dommed. But my SO is very much a dom, yet he\\'s understanding that its not an all-the-time thing. But I\\'m kinda jealous of your lady there, having that control with the underlying passion makes for some amazing times :) There were lots of I love you\\'s, lots of kissing (which is unusual for him,) \"holy fuck you feel amazing,\" etc. It wasn\\'t necessarily rough sex where he was just straight pounding me, it was more that he was in control, did what he want, (but knew the unspoken limits) all while taking care of me. \\n\\nI don\\'t know if that helped explain it or not. I hope so! See, my experience last night felt like both. :) I have had the slow intimate oneness sex by itself and it is amazing but the care he was showing even while being somewhat aggressive was one step further for me. I\\'m glad you\\'ve experienced that as well though :) I have heard that cumming inside if a female is different than just cumming, but if that\\'s what made it memorable then I\\'m glad you have that :) Mm :) My guy wasn\\'t very comfortable with hurting me either but when he pushes me down and does whatever he wants, it\\'s so fucking hot. I\\'m glad you two have discovered that, going slow with it in the beginning is a good idea and listening to each other is very important. My boyfriend have a safe word. Even though we haven\\'t used it yet, it\\'s good to consider the other persons limits. But dang girl 2 weeks is too long! I think you need to take a surprise trip ;) I have to remember this for the next \"lost it\" post I see. Yeah, you definitely need to have sex a lot more than once. Then you can publish your findings in a properly accredited journal, like /r/gonewild. OP\\'s girlfriend is fully soaking two towels with the quantity of fluid expelled, which is a lot more than female ejaculation should be.  And it *is* possible to urinate during sex/orgasm - I don\\'t know where you got the idea that it\\'s impossible, but you\\'re wrong.\\n\\n&gt;Coital incontinence (CI) is urinary leakage that occurs during either penetration or orgasm and can occur with a sexual partner or with masturbation. It has been reported to occur in 10% to 24% of sexually active women with pelvic floor disorders.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence#In_women\\n\\n i have the same problem! what i do is get my hand wet and place it at the base of his dick. then i use it in sync with my mouth to bob up and down really quickly. every 3-5 downward motions, i\\'ll take him all in instead of just the top half so i\\'m deepthroating him. this is also a good way to train your gag reflex!\\n\\nalternatively, i\\'ll deepthroat him and keep him at the back of my throat as i swivel my head back and forth.  do you have a favourite?  hahaha. he is welcome! ;) cum = ejaculate. You mean orgasm.\\n\\nI\\'d suggest trying some sort of vibrator since that would probably be similar to the water flows in the pool but I couldn\\'t help any further. My boyfriend does that, he looks like he\\'s having so much fun when he does it too. DO NOT PUT SOAP NEAR YOUR VAGINA. You will end up with yeast infections and those are very, VERY unpleasant. Buy some freaking lube, for god\\'s sake. Stop hurting yourself! The next step would be lots and lots of foreplay. And stop trying to make anal happen if you can\\'t even manage regular PiV sex yet. Babysteps.  You know what, I\\'ve had a few partners with the same problem. It\\'s not uncommon, as far as I can tell. I just couldn\\'t bend back too far or it would hurt them. Please just ask her to lean forward a bit more. And maybe tell her you\\'ll try every position you can think of to try and make her cum, just not this one. Sex shouldn\\'t be painful (unless you\\'re, you know, into that). I think there is middle ground before a full circumcision if stretches aren\\'t enough. There are creams that can be used, and I think even less dramatic surgeries. Potentially, but it may dig into the front of your hips and be painful. It\\'s not to you because you\\'re *not* Asian and wouldn\\'t know. You don\\'t get to decide what racial terms are and are not offensive to people of races that differ from your own. Ah, yes. I bought my SO some nice Jockey ones that are similar. His ass and thighs look fucking delectable in them and they look much nicer than your standard boxers or boxer briefs. :) Chances are her other partners didn\\'t mention pain if there was any either. Or maybe she was using a slightly different angle, or their body was different so they fit together differently, their dicks were differently sized/shaped, etc.\\n\\nThere are a ton of reasons it may have not happened before, or maybe it did and like you, they didn\\'t say anything.\\n\\nDon\\'t let it hurt your feelings. Tell her that you feel like she is invalidating you and what you are telling her when she says \"Well I\\'ve never had this problem before.\" Clearly it\\'s a problem *now* and it needs to be addressed. Yup, that\\'s what my SO says. He just rubs the head until he pees and makes all kind of funny O faces.  Having had sex with a Vietnamese women before, and living in Vietnam for 2 years, I can say this isn\\'t anything unique or having to do with her being Vietnamese.  I never heard about something like this.  I\\'d say it\\'s just a thing she likes doing to feel close to you. Rugs are Oriental. People are Asian. &gt; Plus a post orgasm piss ( sometimes!) &gt; orgasm; especially when the piss stream kinda goes janky and a bunch of left over sperm comes out and into the toilet.\\n\\nPerhaps it\\'s best not to do that. There is a particular muscle that acts as a valve, switching between sperm and urine. If there is ever a case where you are forcing both openings open at the same time, and there happens to be urine backflow into the vas deference, I\\'m given to understand that this can cause an infection...\\n\\n That\\'s because most boys\\' foreskins aren\\'t retractable until after parents stop bathing them. The foreskin is fused to the glans until puberty, usually, although it can happen earlier/later depending upon the boy\\'s body. A lot of parents forget to teach their kids or think its awkward to talk about that at an older age. Hey OP, late to the party, not a lesbian etc etc etc but here is my input.\\n\\nYou could buy a strapon and introduce the idea of it during sexting, maybe send her a selfie of you wearing it or of some slightly unbuttoned jeans with it poking out a bit.\\n\\nThe closest I guess I could get to experiencing that kind of thing would be a girl wearing some really sexy lingerie or having some bondage stuff  in her handbag or whatever. To me that seems incredibly sexy but I think it\\'s safe to say that\\'s a little different. change that to dance team and im down. Aww, that all sounds amazing :) Minus the locking him in your basement, I don\\'t think he\\'d like that. Yes, it\\'s the comfort and the love after that definitely adds to the experience. I\\'m happy for you. And you should tell him you love him. :) \"Good job bro...girl.\" I like it.  Everyone\\'s is different! What could be amazing to me might be blah to you, but if you haven\\'t had something you consider amazing (and for a long time in my life, I hadn\\'t), I recommend going out and finding yourself some amazing sex :) That\\'s perfect :) I\\'m glad you guys have amazing sex! same thing guys do? well maybe but most guys are just stupid. they think the cock is the only thing that they can show that gets a women going. its not as plain and simple as sing some tits or ass to a guy. I don\\'t have direct experience, but have heard from people who did. The people on the receiving hand seemed to really enjoy it. The people wearing them said it really lowered sensitivity. Some said they preferred just using toys.\\n\\nPersonally, even if you had no sensitivity at all, I can see the upside of using a sleeve over a toy: you\\'re still thrusting rather than moving your hand, and that does change the experience a lot. But your mileage may vary. It\\'s a bit hard to be sure without knowing the kind of pain and its intensity, but the two things that come to mind are size issue and vaginismus.\\n\\nSize difference is the most likely culprit. People are all different, and although we wish we could \"fit\" with the people in our lives, it\\'s not always that simple. If he\\'s too big or you\\'re too tight, the solution is to have more foreplay and use more lube.\\n\\nSome women don\\'t really want to use lube because they feel it makes them a failure as a woman because they couldn\\'t produce it on their own. But sometimes you\\'re aroused and you won\\'t get wet. Even if you get wet, it won\\'t last forever. And even if you get wet, well there are limits to what your natural wetness can do.\\n\\nIn the past, women whose partners were too well-endowed for them may have had to suffer, but we don\\'t have to anymore. Lube is your friend. Definitely give it a try if you haven\\'t yet.\\n\\nAnd if you anticipate pain, you\\'ll probably clench and it will hurt more. So do your best to relax. Have some non-penetrative sex first (masturbation, oral sex...) to make sure you\\'re well relaxed and ready.\\n\\nIf none of that helps and the pain is really bad, quickly read up on vaginismus and see if that could be the reason. But in most cases, the problems are solve through more foreplay and more lube.\\n\\nGood luck! Spanish: \"controllado por el pene\" Tell him after sex that it was really good, but you need just a *little* extra to get you over the edge. Ask him to help you with that. Grab his hand and gently put it between your legs. For me, dirty talk is just talking during sex; openly saying what I would usually keep in my head. For example, when my SO digs her nails into my back, it feels good so I growl/grunt/moan and think about how it makes me want to hold her down and fuck her through the mattress. When dirty talking, I don\\'t just think it, I say it.\\n\\nDirty talk is pretty much just open communication about what you like/want/think/feel during sex. The hotness comes from the situation, the enthusiasm, and sincerity.  It\\'s perfectly normal if you don\\'t like it. Not everyone is the same. I am not \\'sensitive\\' in that way either. Girls have tried, didn\\'t dislike it, was just a \"meh\" experience.  My girlfriend and I had sex for the first time this week. We are in a long distance relationship and have been for a year. Finally got a week alone together and ended up having sex 3 times that day. It was great :) she even came the first time we did it. And then another night we had some great crazy drunken sex. It was awesome.  I could see a lot of American parents being too weird and ashamed about that. And anyway, not every father is going to be uncircumcised/intact. Hay tantas palabras por el pene. Dime todas las que sabes, favor. I can\\'t believe the sexism I\\'m reading in this thread. Sexism on BOTH SIDES. \"All a woman had to do is say yes. Horny guys will fuck anything.\" I mean I expected one or two comments like that. There always are, but this is like every other comment here. All we seem to be accomplishing with this post is re-affirming poor and exaggerated social stigmas. Thank you so much for making men out to complete pigs, and women who are sexually comfortable with themselves to be narcissistic whores, etc. You\\'re kidding. \\nPlease tell me you\\'re kidding.  I cannot believe what\\'s going on here. Seriously. \\n\\nThat fact that this \"only works because she is a woman\" is simply not true. I\\'ve seen so many of my female friends, who are straight up beautiful, date overweight guys. \\n\\nBoys can get laid if they\\'re fat. They can get laid if they’re even mildly attractive. \\n\\nYou are, however, not going to get laid if you act like a whiney little sexist bitch. Nobody likes someone who constantly victimizes themselves, it\\'s annoying and exhausting.  Instead of blaming society and women or whatever the fuck it is you\\'re blaming, take a long hard look in the mirror and fix the root of the problem. Yourself. \\t\\t\\n I\\'m the same way, but I\\'m a woman. \\n The overweight guy wasn\\'t making shit, he just wasn\\'t a prick. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t fucking matter if you\\'re short either. I\\'m 6\\'0 and I dated a guy who was 5\\'5 for four years. It\\'s true, some women value money above anything else. I don\\'t think it\\'s fair to group women into the same category as a toothless crack whore or a stripper, because not all women suck dick for twenty dollar bill. \\n \\nFor fuck sake, there are plenty of women who are willing to make their own money and be with a guy who is emotionally and intellectually stimulating. In fact, most of the girls I know prefer someone with some depth instead of a hard body who is nauseatingly dull and dim witted. \\n\\nI can say these women would never wind up with a guy who\\'s spouting off all of this ridiculous \"truths\". I don\\'t know what kind of women you\\'ve been hanging around or dating, but I\\'m really sorry that they\\'ve made you believe that what you\\'re saying is true.\\n Take it from someone who was a (sort of) classic foreveraloner (22/M, never even kissed a girl at the time of posting), it\\'s not so much anger as it bitterness. At one point the continuous rejection and/or being ignored is going to make you bitter and start resenting the other gender.  Let me make something clear, I am not trying to rally anyones interest by stating that I\\'m sorry you feel this way about women. I really am sorry and disappointed your experiences with women have led you to believe that women are a certain way. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t give less fucks about you or anyone else thinking I\\'m \"different\", I don\\'t want your fucking attention, I\\'m just saying that if you\\'re dating these types of women you\\'re looking in the wrong places. \\n\\nIt\\'s very clear to me that whatever energy you\\'re putting out is coming back to you.\\n\\nSome men are just as obnoxious about their preferences for women as women are about theirs for men. I work in a bike shop with perverse old men and they critique every single women who comes into the shop like they\\'d be able to bag her no problem.\\n\\nIt goes both ways, and if this woman has come to her own conclusion about sexuality and her body there is NOTHING, abso-fucking-lutely NOTHING wrong with her wanting to encourage other women to do the same. \\n     Personally, my biggest rule is to be gentle with the balls but you can go as hard at it with the actual penis and glans. Pressure is good, lightly scraping with the teeth can also be good. Just don\\'t squeeze down with teeth. Oh, and eye contact. Something that ruins it for me is if all I can see is her bobbing hair. Pin that shit back. Guys are visual. I want to see my penis going in and out of her mouth. I want to see her expression as she\\'s giving me head Ah, the feminazi insult.\\n\\nPretty amusing that you\\'re saying I have a standardized answer for everything.  My ex wanted to bang like a jackrabbit on birth control. I\\'m not running with anything, I just don\\'t want to argue about stupid shit. \\nYou have your opinion, I have mine. \\nSo the conversation is over. \\n\\n Also an opinion.  I had an ex that was the same way. A few times of saying things like \"those are *my* tits, I want to see them\", she became very comfortable banging with the lights on/covers off. Dude, I\\'m done with it. \\n\\nNo matter what I say you\\'re going to find something to argue with me about. Do you, and I\\'ll do me.  Don\\'t think that this is your fault! A lot of guys have difficulty orgasming from handjobs/blowjobs, and it\\'s not even necessarily because of excessive masturbation/deathgrip--some guys are just like that. My boyfriend is that way; he assures me that he loves the oral I give him, and that it feels wonderful, but he just doesn\\'t cum from it. And many other guys are the same way. I\\'m sure this has nothing to do with your skill; please don\\'t worry about it. :)\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering what can be done to help you feel better about this, though, I may have a suggestion. Try giving him head for 10-15 minutes, (or however long he/you want), then have him jack off while you kiss him/play with his balls/etc. Then right when he\\'s close to cumming, go back down on him and have him finish in your mouth. It works really well for my boyfriend and I, might be worth a shot!\\n\\nBut really, don\\'t think that you\\'re doing anything wrong, or that this is a shortcoming of yours. I\\'m sure you\\'re just fine, and chances are, he loves getting oral from you regardless of whether or not he cums from it. If you\\'re still feeling unsettled about this, then you can always try talking to him about it; but honestly, I don\\'t think there\\'s any problem with either you or him. \\n\\nGood luck! Happy sexing. :) /r/nonmonogamy would be a good choice too, better than /r/polyamory. Your religion is making you so unhappy that you are suicidal... which is also a sin.  Take some time and think about that.  Consider if this religion is making you happy and is how you want to live your life. good move this is. Poke it with your finger A good friend of mine moans when he eats something especially tasty.  Apparently he\\'s been doing it since he was a toddler and his parents never stopped him because they thought he\\'d outgrow it, and now it\\'s just ingrained.  I was talking with his ex about it and apparently he moans in bed a lot too haha.   I used to feel the same way about the same kind of porn. Ultimately it just took some reading about gender identity issues and time spent contemplating it for me to come to accept it. Or maybe he\\'s accepted that he has different capabilities than other guys and would just be happy that a woman was trying to work toward a solution with him for once instead of ducking out. It\\'s hard to say. I don\\'t get the joke :( Woman #2, reporting in. \\n It *should* but that\\'s just not how most people work. To think otherwise is overly optimistic. \\r\\rNew relationships are full of excitement and discovery and a ton of feel good happy chemicals are being offloaded into your system. Longer relationships don\\'t have that to the degree that new ones do, if at all.  If you really had body image issues I don\\'t know if you\\'d be going to a sex club and sexing people you just met. It just doesn\\'t sound like a \"shy\" person thing to do.  I\\'m turning 22 in a month, I\\'d be happy just to get a kiss on the cheek. Not that I expect something like that to happen. Oh ok, thank you! Oh ok thank you! Me (25) and my boyfriend decided to get the 5yr IUD and due to take it out in August. AHHHH! Well its been amazing! Best choice and would recommend it to any responsible couple. I haven\\'t figured out if I want to get it replaced or what not. : / I\\'m not excited to possibly be going back to condoms. It\\'s nice to not worry! \\n\\nTL/DR: IUD all the way!  It\\'s also rude to classify trans people as \"pre-op\".  Transitioning isn\\'t a before-and-after process, not everyone gets surgery. They aren\\'t, perfectly normal people do stuff like that all the time.  It isn\\'t desperate or a last resort, it\\'s a valid choice.  Dating sites are definitely more mainstream than sex clubs, so maybe go with that first? &gt;I feel like people (\"normal\") just walk out, talk to people, and then sex kind of just flows naturally. Is that true?\\n\\nNo?  Sex, for most people, comes from relationships.  Ask people out on dates, things progress from there. I travel in a lot of queer circles, that could be it :) Focus on **her** instead of yourself.  How often do you eat her out?  How often does she come - without faking it?  \\n\\nIf you make her feel good, she\\'ll want to make you feel good.  She\\'s a person.  You can\\'t just make her want to fuck, she has to actually want it.  And sometimes she just won\\'t be in the mood.  **Deal with it.**  Or talk to her about it, be open in communication. Maintaining a relationship with an abuser is still **really** unhealthy regardless.   &gt; a guy who is not Jewish\\n\\nMany Muslim men, especially from Turkey, are circumcised too. I don\\'t see why you should hush that voice in your head. It sucks, but it\\'s reality. Some people wouldn\\'t be that bothered by it, and you are, so maybe you aren\\'t meant for each other. I don\\'t see that as something that\\'s gonna go away, like I feel it would always be in my mind.\\n\\nDo what you want. You can stick it out and see if it goes away, but if it doesn\\'t, it might be time to part ways. \\n\\nI don\\'t know if I\\'d tell him that\\'s the reason you ended it though.... I feel like that would be crushing. \\n\\nI feel like personally I can\\'t continue dating someone if I don\\'t think they\\'re perfect. Like not 100%, but I can\\'t see flaws in them that don\\'t go away after some time. I wish this was the case with my experience.  I\\'m an American female, and the only time I have had sex outside of the US was with an Israeli soldier like 3 or 4 years ago. I\\'d say the main difference for me was how much music played a part in his seduction process before and after. His English wasn\\'t very strong, and neither is my Hebrew, so I think he felt music would be an easier transition. Although it would have been nice if he spoke Hebrew near the end, but I think he was too shy. Well I went to a small private school growing up where Hebrew was actually taught kindergarten through eighth grade, so you think by the time I went to Israel at 21 that I would have a good understanding of it. It got better once I practiced with some locals but not speaking a language for 8 years makes you rusty. Exercise/diet/zinc/ginseng /daa.\\n\\nFor me,  just adding junk back into my diet, I was in a highly restrictive diet before. Took a few weeks to start coming back, and still not  100% from a year ago but defo getting better still!  A lot also due to stress and other personal factors.  German is sexy, at least when a woman is speaking it. If it\\'s a guy it can either sound scary, stiff and formal, or flamboyant. Better than trying to get a girl drunk and getting messy in the wrong ways and all those issues, or mix it up. In my past I thought this was horrific but now I see it as  (still seedy)  but at least not an asshole for  drugging and /or manipulation.  I bet Jewish it was you! Agree. 87% is an out of date number. I\\'d cite personal experience but I know how you folks hate anecdotes. *scribbles notes* Really at birth? As far as I know it is done to 4 to 5 year olds in Turkish culture. It\\'s only a requirement for shafiitic and hanbalitic Sunnis and Shiites. All other schools recommend circumcision, though.\\n\\nIn Turkey and with other turkic people circumcision traditionally is done before the start of puberty, usually between the 4th and 9th birthday. Not wanting to tell my partner but if she does something somewhat driven  (her work well/clean stuff /do something morally great etc. To demonstrate being a good person/thoughtfulness) and gives me a massage,  I\\'m in.  Pulling out is not reliable birth control. That is my opinion. Upvote just for your contributions to global goodwill.  Communicate often, don\\'t be shy, or communicate that you are shy. Also the best tip I can give any girl, just show him that you want him. Don\\'t need any fancy positions or anything most of the time, just needing to bang is enough to do the trick  Thanks. That\\'s a good tip. Other people responded to the original post. My comment was commentary, which seems apt to me.  Does the context change yet again in the full line?\\n\\n\"Du hast mich gefragt und ich hab nichts gesagt\"\\n\\nEven the first time I heard the song, having no background in German at all, it struck me as being like that song \"I\\'m a dick / I\\'m addicted to you\".\\n\\n(Yes, I know Du Hast is older, it\\'s just a phonetic trick and I can\\'t think of another example right now.) Attractive, older single lady who travels a lot for work and can flirt in 10 or so languages and dialects? While I don\\'t want to ruin my chances of hitting on a Reddit basement dweller someday, I\\'ll say I\\'ve certainly noticed a trend in the younger studs I manage to drag back to my lair.  Pick some days, and setup whose days they are.  Pick a time, too, to reinforce that *it\\'s going to happen*.  If the time arrives and nobody is moving, announce that you\\'re going to go get ready, or tell him to go get comfortable.\\n\\nAsk him if he\\'s comfortable with you dominating him a little bit with commands.  Example: \"Oh god that feels good, please lick harder!\" or \"I\\'m going to ride your face until I cum!\"\\n\\nThis makes it sound less critical and more dominant.  Not sure if he\\'s into that though, so good luck!\\n\\nNOTE: I forgot your post was about *him becoming more dominant, too*!  Ask submissive questions, you can \"take control\" in a submissive way that prompts his dominance -- this will also help to ease him into the role.  If he sees your submissive side, he might step up to fill the void. (no pun intended)  Examples: Ask permission, or ask if you\\'ve been bad, or things like that.  Maybe play reverse psychology by agreeing that if you beg him *not to do something*, that he will turn around and do it -- thereby turning it into a fun little psychological game where you ask without asking and he dominates by doing something \"you didn\\'t want\". You haven\\'t met any drunk Bogan/Occa Australian women yet have you?\\n\\n \"*Where women go and men blunder*?\" For every dead brill Aussie girl you find, there\\'ll be an occa or two squawking. Legally in the US, fingering is not rape.  It is sexual assault, indecent assault, etc, but it is not, in any state of the US, \\'rape\\'.  Im surprised you\\'re getting downvoted for just stating legal facts, but hey, this is reddit where feelings are more important than facts, right? Very jealous.  I hear stories of blacking out and being delirious and I want that.  The male orgasm, while great, is so much briefer. I think he might mean rågbröd. Those symptoms are common with PMS. I would think that your hormones might be a little changed from the change in sexual activity. It\\'s causing your period symptoms to appear. Definitely see a doctor if you are unsure. If it were me I\\'d give it a week to see if it doesn\\'t go away on its own. Dude you\\'re 15.   Pretty sure you don\\'t have it ED.  Why?  Because you\\'re 15.  Keep messing around with your girl, and go slow.  Make out for a while, and then start pulling clothes off and do lots of foreplay. I didn\\'t lose my virginity until I was 18 in college.  I didn\\'t even kiss my first girl until freshman year of college.  This sounds stupid, but it will  happen.  You want to get laid?  Go out and chase some tail.  Ask that friend out and ask other people out.    Not sure why you\\'re getting downvoted; I think that\\'s a totally fair assessment. I haven\\'t even slept with anyone outside of America, I just know that we have a major culture of shame when it comes to sex. I dated a guy from Germany a short time while in college. He was inexperienced and pretty terrible in bed, but I was hanging in there until the day we were having sex and he started singing, \"plug it in, plug it in\".  You know, the old Glade Plug-Ins jingle. No vestige of desire survived. I could come to your house and slap the shit out of you but i dont think that would get the point across. You have to have the powerin your self to want to change. You where anxious. thats normal. Keep trying. If I saw someone swimming in shark infested water I\\'d warn them. It\\'s a similar situation here in my eyes.\\n\\nEdit: swypo. Honestly I find your whole \"not having sex because our friend in the other room might hear\" thing to be really weird and kind of...juvenile? It might be slightly awkward for him to overhear, but it\\'s kind of expected and normal when you\\'re crashing with a couple. I\\'d think you were being way prudish and overly cautious if I was your girlfriend. I can\\'t tell you how many times I\\'ve heard roommates having sex or crashed at a friend\\'s place and overheard them. It\\'s awkward for like 2 seconds and then it\\'s not. When you\\'re descended from criminals, it kinda turns out like that. I\\'m sorry, but you\\'re going to be hard pressed to find any guy that\\'s going to *pluck* his shaft hair for you.  Plucking just one of those bad boys is my personal version of hell. just have sex in the house. Your parents do it and you live with them\\n Don\\'t be the neighbourhood creep. It will get out and you will be  paedo shamed / worse. 30+ here, none of whom were uncircumcised. I must be the girl version of you, because I\\'m the same way. I had a roommate for 6 months and sex was weird for me because of it. Then I found out that she\\'d heard me and my husband once, and I couldn\\'t even fathom the idea of sex while she was home for a couple weeks. It was weird. I\\'m very private about my sex life, while my husband would love to talk about it. He respects me and doesn\\'t talk about it much, which is great, but it has been a point of contention before. \\n\\nI wish I could say that it\\'ll change or something, but my friends think I\\'m a little silly for being so private about it, and my husband just respects my privacy and doesn\\'t bring it up or try anything unless I explicitly say it\\'s all right. It took a while to get to that point, though.  24 I had the exact same problem. First yeast infection of my life. Scared the shit out of me for a bit. this sounds so toxic. Find someone else It could be nerves or it could be technique. Nerves seems more likely. Can you come quicker from blowjobs/handjobs/whateverjobs? It\\'ll be down to nerves. It\\'ll get better as you feel more comfortable with her. The best way to do that is to communicate with her  It happened to me once over a year ago and yet I still don\\'t expect it. There was nothing exceptional about the sex, it just happened. I think what this advice tells me is to not focus on an orgasm. That has helped me greatly because I used to obsess over it and could not enjoy myself at all. Now i just discovered that I can bring myself to the edge with my clit and then my partners cock does the rest while we\\'re having sex. \\n\\nThe reason that you may have noticed your partners are this way is because the ones who can get off through PIV have never had a reason to research it. However the ones who have noticed that they can\\'t have probably googled the issue and realized that they\\'re not broken and its actually normal. \\n Risk is risk. If they\\'re pulling out or using BC pills they\\'re concerned with not having a child. If you feel that either a shark bite or a child are not life changing experiences then you\\'re the idiot.  Dude was either a manipulative liar or fucked in the head beyond you ever understanding. Either way, don\\'t sweat it. &gt; The way I\\'ve always masturbated is very difficult to recreate with a guy. I lay on my stomach and clutch my entire vulva, over my underwear and just grind away. I also really want to stop using this method because it makes it almost impossible to feel anything through clitoral stimulation.\\n\\nBut that *is* clitoral stimulation; the shaft of the clit extends into the body a huge amount, starting under the mons. There are a tonne of us grinders out there. I don\\'t come from \"twiddling\" either -- but I can come with partners during sex in a few good positions.\\n\\n[Here\\'s](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1724jq/women_of_reddit_how_do_you_really_masturbate/c81i06n) a great link on \"how do you masturbate\" from some time ago, where high pressure grinding was the second-most popular response. From my post explaining the sensation to a confused dude:\\n\\n&gt;...grinding and pressure all the way up the shaft of the clit, not just the head. When you jerk your dick, you probably pull the shaft, not tickle the head, right? Same with pressure/grinding on the mons pubis for women.\\nImagine you were getting a blowjob from a girl and all she ever did was lick, suck, and tickle the head of your penis. Not only would this not get you off, it would probably be hypersensitive to the point of discomfort. Now imagine that you just hunker down and try and learn to come that way anyhow, since that\\'s the only blowjob you ever seem to get.....\\nANYWAY. The gist is, stimulating the whole clit is always going to be more successful than stimulating just the head. Even though I can come with my legs open, I\\'m still 99% more likely to succeed if I\\'m face-down and applying pressure somehow (cowgirl, lazy dog, etc).\\n\\n[Here\\'s](http://blog.museumofsex.com/the-internal-clitoris/) an article on the internal clitoris. And [here\\'s](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1724jq/women_of_reddit_how_do_you_really_masturbate/c81waek) a list of positions I\\'ve found successful. You are not alone! I am sorry about your relationship struggles, but deciding that your method of coming is flawed and somehow so are you? Logically fallacious, girl. I\\'ll be honest this sounds like something out of /r/incest, it\\'s almost like they\\'re trying to bait you into joining. I really hope that isn\\'t the case, but the best way to get it handled is to have a conversation with them about privacy and their sex life. Hopefully they\\'ll get the idea.  Good, and just to be clear I agree with everyone else that communication is going to be key here. Let them know this makes you uncomfortable. The only reason I bring up /r/incest is that their behavior are things I\\'ve specifically seen brought up as ways to coerce younger generations into gaining interest. I honestly do hope it isn\\'t the case.  This is way beyond \"having a conversation about it\". You\\'re only together for 3 months; get the hell out.\\n\\nEdit: Just saw you\\'ve brooken up. Good.  I don\\'t know where you\\'re from but in my social circles that\\'s neither common nor acceptable behavior. I hate to deliver another anecdote contrary to what you\\'re hoping, but my wife also took Plan B. Our daughter is 2 1/2 and adorable. So that\\'s fun. Yeah, except it\\'s possible to fake this, too. I know I\\'ve done it in the past, for the exact reason that some people think it can\\'t be faked. Pullout method. Actually worked for a few months, but I got back from a work trip and had a particularly passionate encounter and a small portion made it inside her. She took plan B within 6 hours.\\n\\nFor the record, we knew what we were doing, and were in a place to raise a child. She was just between bc methods due to some major hormone fluctuations we were letting settle out. As a bisexual girl with a penis, do you tend to avoid penetrating your partner when you\\'re with a girl?  Exactly this. I had to buy my own sex toys at 15. You know how expensive good sex toys are for a 15yo? UNLEASH THE KRAKEN! GO TEAM! so to clarify: are you saying people of other races and genders react positively or neutrally to this story, whereas specifically black women react negatively? I know, like I said, we knew the chances. But no, I had been traveling for work, the way the timing worked out, that was the one and only event that could have resulted in conception.  Personally, I LOVE the deep throating/mouth fucking deal. My boyfriend gets really into it, makes a lot of noises, says how amazing it feels, etc, and it turns me on like fucking crazy to know how much pleasure I\\'m bringing him. So no, don\\'t worry about these things being degrading. :)  With me, tears after sex is the biggest thumbs-up I could possibly give. There\\'s something about being so emotionally and physically connected with someone I love that just brings on the waterworks. It can take a while to get used to (he was automatically concerned I was in pain) but when the tears are interrupted by little whimpers of \"Oh my wow, oh my wow,\" this is a good sign. :)  If she\\'s reassuring you that it\\'s a good thing, then she loves it! Sometimes the emotions overwhelm you to the point you feel like you could burst, and tears are natural in that situation. \\nAlthough I understand why it would be off-putting.

Stress can cause it to be late along with a bunch of other reasons. If you\\'ve had negative pregnancy tests, I\\'d doubt she\\'s pregnant, but it\\'s happened before I guess. ....well ironically the websites down for me? Bingo. Women were being told for YEARS that they should orgasm easily from PIV. If the pendulum\\'s swung the other way at the moment, that\\'s why. You\\'re better off with a remote-controlled vibrating egg or similar. The ones that come packaged with panties tend to be kinda cruddy and/or overpriced, in my experience.\\n\\nDoc Johnson makes a wireless egg that\\'s good and has 5+ functions, and is really quiet. It\\'ll retail for somewhere between $30-$50, I\\'m guessing. If you have bigger bucks to spend and want something REALLY, REALLY COOL, check out the We-Vibe. The latest models are remote-controlled, fully submersible in water, absolutely discreet (they \"clip on\" to the vulva hands-free, are really ergonomic and won\\'t make a bulge in the panties), very very quiet and rechargeable. \\n\\nI also recommend going into your local sex shop and asking about it. Independent sex-positive shops are amazing, and even big-box chain superstores will have staff who are educated on product and can give you information. It\\'s really helpful to talk to a real person and see the products before you make a non-returnable purchase. Do you trim with a beard trimmer? Well, I don\\'t personally find it degrading if the woman is on board and enthusiastic about it.\\n\\nI would say that most women probably do not like these acts, but I would also say they probably have never actually experienced them, and even though most don\\'t like it, it\\'s not outside the realm of normal at all.\\n\\nLet me put it this way. My best friend thinks that me letting my fiance blow his load on my face, which I really enjoy doing once in awhile, is degrading, but she also talks about how much she loves anal sex, which is something I\\'m personally not that into. My other best friend used to have an open marriage and let her husband fuck other women, which is absolutely not something I could or would do, and she also thought my fiance blowing his load on my face was degrading. Basically what I\\'m getting at is that everyone has different preferences and limits. To each their own, as long as everyone is being safe and engaging in acts that they *want* to engage in. Same with me. But I know there are women who wouldn\\'t be interested in a lot of the stuff I like, either. And that\\'s cool- we\\'re all different. As long as we enjoy what we\\'re doing and it\\'s all consenting, we\\'re good to go! Good luck in your journey learning how to deepthroat! What? Are you replying to the correct comment? \"Vigorous dick washing\" isn\\'t required. I\\'m an uncut, American man and I practice proper hygiene and safe sex as much as any circumcised man *should*. If you aren\\'t washing your dick once a day, that\\'s disgusting and unhygienic in my opinion, regardless of how much or how little skin you have down there. How difficult is it to purchase this? How expensive is it? Why isn\\'t this a bigger story? This sounds amazing. Haha, okay, I was really confused by your response after reading the urban dictionary link. That\\'s funny. 0/27 Are the only things iv not done onthis list.\\n\\nHad sex in a car □\\nHad sex in a plane bathroom □\\nDrunk sex □\\nHad sex with more than one person □ well Ive done it to the new Avenged sevenfold album and it was just hot sweaty mean passion. so I would say just have uptempo music  To everyone who doesn\\'t get it,\\n\\nThis comic came from a time before the whole sex positive thing gained traction.  Where does it say it causes painful orgasms? I\\'ve had dry orgasms both while masturbating and while receiving oral sex, I noticed no difference in sensation and had no idea it was dry during the oral sex until she said something. That first one reminds me of Liz Lemon only getting horny when she organizes things. Until you get the one that taste\\'s really bad :( Silicone-based lubricant. It\\'s not for lack of imagination, it\\'s just hard to do any of these things without a second person. Oh, i thought it would be a few years older than that. God, what am I *not* into is an easier question!  I\\'m into most the things in this thread, my only real hard limits being blood/scat/extreme violence (but being rough is a plus!)\\n\\nMy newest kink has to be financial domination.  It just ties all my other kinks together so well.  I\\'ve always loved homewrecking and femdom stuff, and the idea of ruining a man by sucking his bank account dry is just so hot.  To be completely honest I don\\'t want to actually ruin anyone, it is just a fantasy, but I\\'ve had some guys give me money which is amazing.  I mean, yes, having my textbooks covered is great, but more than that the token of them paying me makes me so wet.  I had roleplayed FD stuff before, but even having a little bit of money in makes it oh-so-good.\\n\\n If anyone calls anyone else a blood-sucking home-wrecking whore, it\\'s sexist and discriminating (unless they truly are a vampiric homewrecker).  The difference is that this is play.  In some femdom stuff I say incredibly sexist stuff against men, but I don\\'t really mean it in the least, it\\'s just play and fantasy talk, and the guys get off on it. \\n\\nYou see the difference between an actual insult and dirty talk, right?\\n\\n\\n\\n Nothing makes a man harder then a woman crying sweet sweet tears of humiliation lol Shaming inception...woah Evolution wants you to have that drive to get pregnant and reproduce so I\\'d say that\\'s a very sensible fetish Older guys. But like 25+ years older than me. Just a fantasy at the moment... I literally have to control myself when I go down on my wife. As she\\'s getting close and I\\'m squirming all around trying to get her over the edge it just gets hotter and hotter. I have cum without touching myself numerous times from her finally cumming, screaming and bucking, pushing my face into her. Safe to say, I make some noises.\\n\\nHave to keep a second set of sheets ready to go.  I can\\'t help but think of a dude named Edward smith who claims to have had sex with over 1000 cars. I\\'m pretty sure he had sex with a helicopter too Ah yes the distinction between the clinical use of the word fetish vs the common usage of the term Sex ≠ Penis Performance\\n\\nThere are many other ways to keep the fun going that do not rely on an erection.  You have a tongue and fingers, use them!  Truthfully, I wouldn\\'t even be past kissing a neck or oral 5 minutes into sex.\\n\\nI\\'m just gonna be honest, if you\\'ve busted a nut 5 minutes in, you\\'re doing sex *wrong*.  Develop your mental pre-game.  Touch her body, make sure to touch all of it.  Kiss it, smell it, tell her what she makes you want to do.  Tease her, pretend that you are starting, but then stop.  Make her want it.\\n\\nTL;DR: Sex should have a warm-up period. Don\\'t fucking kick the door down, vomit on yourself and pass out on the floor. This is true, I\\'ve only been with white men. Interesting.  Psychologically it\\'s awesome, because then we know 2 things:\\n\\n1. That it\\'s okay to cum\\n2. We know where you\\'d like us to do it\\n\\nAs long as the cum comes into contact with your body, it\\'s awesome, getting clarification makes it more awesome. It is perfectly fine if you do not like sex toys.  I will say that romantic sex and the use of sex toys are not mutually exclusive, though.  You can have fun romantic sexual encounters, even if you use toys.  For a lot of us guys, toys give us a little more confidence that if we lose control early on, we still have a way to make sure your fun can continue as long as necessary.\\n\\nDon\\'t overthink the toys.  They aren\\'t *for him*, they might help him help you, but that\\'s the idea.  It increases what he is capable of doing for you. He may be borderline depressed/stressed.  Either one of those can completely kill his libido.  Working as much as he does could easily overstress him or depress him.  If he feels like a work mule, he needs to find a way to unwind/destress; for me, this would be what you\\'re offering, but everyone is different. Perhaps you should invest in some finger cots? Girls who like my hair are my kryptonite. Sadly the only people who ever express much interest in playing with it are drunk girls, who usually don\\'t stick around that long. The sensation on my scalp of someone else running their hands through my hair is really pleasant. they make spray that numbs the penis and that has been known to help Reminds me of the manga \"absolute boyfriend\"  I would be... well, pretty darn surprised if she is actually having orgasms. She doesn\\'t even sound like she\\'s gotten physically aroused by the time she\\'s getting dressed again. She\\'s going to cheat if you don\\'t stop the bastard. Obviously your wife wants him as well  :/\\n\\nSorry dude  :\\'( Don\\'t Bank on it. Might be as fruitless as blackfrairs Yeah, wear a helmet.  She\\'s in her sexual prime while you\\'re on the downward slope.  Unlike a 29 year old woman, she\\'s had a few years to get used to the idea of a libido and has hopefully figured what she wants in bed.  So strap up and hang on! If I were you, I would have left.  Yes! In fact I couldn\\'t figure out why I was so revved up last week until it came this week (I knew it was coming I was just too busy cumming to put two and two together) \\n\\nI also get easily excited during the bodily destruction, which I find strange because when I\\'m not crossing my legs to avoid scratching the itch I\\'m a generally miserable person at that time.  **YES** a thousand times!!! Not having a boyfriend during that time SUCKS This happens to my best friend. But she starts fantasizing about guys not even her type. It\\'s strange.  Wow that\\'s dedication! You can only control what *you* are doing.  If she is sufficiently turned on, hopefully she will reciprocate. Oh I meant physically lol Yep. I have posted &amp; very unpredictable cycles (like 2-3 months apart, starting randomly) and this is the most reliable sign that I\\'m about to start. Go to /r/iama and search for \"web cam\" and you\\'ll likely find this information already there; several times. I\\'m happy I\\'m not the only one. Then the week after my period my sex drive takes a nose dive. It\\'s frustrating :/ I wish i was better able to control it.  This is gonna sound harsh.\\n\\nJudging from your original post, you sound beta as fuck. You panicked like a little girl when you couldn\\'t find her and kept begging your girlfriend to not see anyone. Beg? Really?\\n\\nBreak up with this girl. She\\'s just comfortable with you. She doesn\\'t find you sexually appealing.\\n\\nShe already cheated anyway. And if you\\'re going to be alpha, you shouldn\\'t hang around her kind. \\n\\nJust look at how your posted your cries for help. Just read it over and over. Look at how it makes you look. I get that you need help. I understand that. But don\\'t sound like a panicky little girl writing in her blog. That type of personality pushes girls away.\\n\\nGo to r/seduction or r/relationships for help. But don\\'t sound like a baby about it. \\n\\nIf you want a woman to like you for real, just ask yourself: what would James Bond do?\\n\\nIf he wouldn\\'t do it, then it\\'s probably beta.\\n\\nEdit: If you want to get a great girlfriend/wife, improve yourself first.\\n\\nAnyone who disagrees is probably just a baby. Honestly. Work on yourself, improve yourself, and shit like this won\\'t happen. AND DO NOT, EVER, TAKE HER BACK.\\n\\nShe will inevitably regret all this and she absolutely, 100%, will come crawling back. Do not choose her over the feelings you\\'re experiencing now. Those will eventually pass and I *know* you can find better.  Cialis lasts 36-70+ hrs dude. Unless you did this with viagra, you\\'ve only proved cialis works and you probably over dosed on it. Dude, your dick size sounds perfect. I\\'m an 8-incher myself and often get complaints when I hit a girl\\'s cervix. Rough sex is hard. I envy you. *how happy I could be with our sex life if I opened the doors to let her explore her sexuality. No, I wasn\\'t allowed to do the same.*\\n\\n\"I want to be a whore, but I want you all to myself after I have satisfied all my urges with other people.\"  What a cunt.  Sorry man. Hell, blowing the guy in the Olive Garden bathroom is classier than blowing him in the parking lot of a Taco Bell! Bitch has issues and obviously does not love you. Dump that whore and move on. Or in other words: Delete Facebook, hit the gym, lawyer up.  Hang in there dude, it\\'ll get better. Yep, cut her out 100% and do your best to live a great life. Not as far as I know. It depends on local laws though.  &gt; He often begins concentrating too much during blowjobs (OCD) and becomes worried he won\\'t be able to finish \\n\\nOkay, that\\'s pretty normal so just scratch that one. At least with average BJ\\'s.\\n\\n&gt; What can I do that will help my guy?\\n\\nIf the actions you\\'ve already taken aren\\'t working, join him in relationship counseling. Your dude is damaged goods and professional help seems appropriate, not Reddit. I generally consider blowing someone in the same room that tons of people shit and piss in everyday to be a pretty low *blow* to one\\'s classiness. At least in the parking lot, you\\'re probably in someone\\'s car, which may or may not be a shitty place. Yeah that place is dirty dirty haha Oh yeah I ordered it online with a prepaid visa at the time. Didn\\'t have to step foot in a sex shop.  Go ask your doctor, this is definitely not normal. It sounds like vaginismus. Yes. Are you? We should have a play date Well so do you with your childish insults. \"Are your 14?\" Like I haven\\'t heard that one before. OP, X-post to /r/askengineers surely someone can whip out some calculations.  Like people said, your doctor will be able to help you.\\n\\nI had a septate hymen, which means a strand of tissue is stretched across the opening. This caused sometimes unbearable, sometimes light pain during sex because it never broke, just painfully stretched. Last year it finally broke and I was amazed at how painless sex was after.\\n\\nSo it could be that, or it could be something else. Go to your doctor. Same for me. PP is not sliding scale where I live. I went on a coffee date with a cute guy from POF a couple of years ago. We met, talked, laughed. \\n\\nWhen we got home he texted that he had a good time and also to let me know that he was \"looking for something more casual\". I was cool with it and a week or two later we met up and had sex in his jeep.\\n\\n\\nI liked that it was after we met up briefly. If I get a message straight to the point like that on POF or OKCupid I\\'m off put by it This is a tricky situation. He seems to realise he\\'s done something very wrong and feels sorry, but also seems to think that having sex with you when you\\'re telling him not to is something other than rape.\\n\\nThat could be because he knew you consented to the sex, just not the lack of condoms. Maybe he feels it\\'s quite different than forcing himself on someone who doesn\\'t want to have sex at all.\\n\\nI think you should tell him that you felt unrespected when he didn\\'t seem to care about how you felt and kept going. That you think sex is something that should happen when both people are completely into what\\'s happening, and that you want to feel secure that if something become uncomfortable, painful, awkward or if for any other reason you want to stop, that he will stop as soon as you ask him. It\\'s a matter of trust. He has proven that he might keep going, not the whole way but at least a bit, and that can be shattering for your trust.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m willing to believe he feels terrible, will be more careful and won\\'t do it again, he needs to be able to prove that to you, so that you can trust him. And I believe it might take some time before you\\'re a 100% sure that in the same situation, he would stop right away instead of waiting.\\n\\nTell him you think consent is more than wanting to have sex vs not wanting to have sex, it\\'s also about the type of sex. That includes, for instance, vaginal, oral or anal. That includes with or without condoms. That includes being awake vs being asleep. Tell him you believe your boundaries should be discussed clearly so that you don\\'t cross the line with one another.\\n\\nIf he was ever into, say, tying you up, for instance, you\\'d need to trust that he would stop if you got scared, that he would not do things while you can\\'t fight that you wouldn\\'t want, that he would untie you if it started hurting, that he wouldn\\'t just leave the room and leave you there. All these things require trust. I\\'m not saying he\\'s ever going to tie you up, but this is an example of why trust is so important, and he broke it. And it can be regained, but he needs to admit that he did break your trust.\\n\\nHim saying that he would never hurt you on purpose is one thing, and good, but he needs to realise how scary it was that you told him you didn;t want to do something sexual to you and he still did. That you want your \"No\"s to carry more weight, and that of course you will return the favour. That there is no \"one more minute\" when someone says \"stop\" during sex.\\n\\nGood luck, it seems like a very difficult talk. Do tell him you\\'re not trying to make him feel bad, but you want to make sure that you can work together towards rebuilding trust in your relationship, because while it didn\\'t affect you as badly as it could have, it was still scary for you.\\n\\nEDIT: Something else that\\'s important is that it\\'s not like he didn\\'t know and it was an accident. You\\'ve told him multiple times that you\\'re not willing to have sex without a condom, and by doing it anyways he was basically saying that your opinion on the matter is not relevant/important. This is your body and it was a clear lack of respect on his part. It broke in a really terrible sexual encounter. My doctors never noticed anything wrong. \\n\\n(Tmi to follow)\\n\\nI figured it out in a couple ways. I\\'ve never really used tampons a lot, but on several occasions they would get stuck. Also, when I was learning to masturbate, I thought I had torn something because I could wrap my fingers around it. Kinda scared me away for a while. \\n\\nAccording to what I\\'ve read, doctors can find it and rectify it really easily if they are looking for it. I\\'m just curious, how old are you two? My guy and I were eachother\\'s firsts and it took a couple months to really really understand eachothers bodies. I\\'ve been trying to for years, but.. just.. how? I keep gagging. There\\'s an easy cure for yeast infections that doesn\\'t actually require any medication. Just get some plain yoghurt with culture and use it as a cream. If you feel any relief, maybe it was a yeast infection. If so, let your partner get some anti fungal cream because he\\'s been infected too (symptoms or no) and he\\'ll re-infect you. I have no advice. However I would like to wish you the best and pray your daughter was trolling  you.  I have no advice. However I would like to wish you the best and pray your daughter was trolling  you.  Male ownership? :| THERE IS HOPE \"OMG LOOK AT MY FINGERS\" How long have you guys been having sex? I only have one account, idgaf. Maybe they\\'re all too busy having third level orgasms? Actually, I LOVE oral, it\\'s my favorite thing to do besides PIV. And the taste is fine, too. It\\'s just that squirt at the back of my throat that gets the gag reflex going. Yeah that\\'s pretty much my situation.  You could be reinfecting each other. You should both get diagnosed and treated. It can be asymptomatic in men. I\\'m 20 and I like to think I have pretty positive views regarding sex, especially where my parents(divorced) are  concerned. I don\\'t get grossed out when I think of them having sex lives, I think it\\'s healthy. Now with that said, I could not imagine in a million years crossing the line where  your daughter has. She sext her own father. Maybe it could have been a joke if it was a couple of texts and she was just trying to help her mom get some (which even that is still weird in my opinion) but to have the conversation go between 30-40 messages? That is beyond abnormal and is crossing a huge line. I think you need to talk with her (possibly with getting some outside professional help) and get down to *why* she thought what she did was okay.  Deeply surprised that it took this much scrolling to get to someone with a head on their shoulders. Never in a million years did this happen, jesus fuck. What ever happened to dildoes? Can\\'t we just lube one another? Well I live in Colorado, where it gets quite cold (especially during winter) at night, so sex \"at the park,\" \"in the parking lot,\" etc. generally conveys that a car is involved somewhere in that statement just because it would be bitterly cold for one\\'s lady or man parts to be so bare in Colorado weather haha. Pfft, that\\'s nothing. All I need to do is remain a virgin until the age of 30 and I can become a Level 128 Grand Wizard! I\\'m glad it went well :) Rape is such a strong word that people try to avoid using it because they don\\'t want to associate it with themselves. They think \"I screwed up by having sex with her when she told me not to, but I\\'m not *a rapist*! I would never want to hurt her! I would never assault a stranger!\"\\n\\nBut really it\\'s like thinking \"I took some gum from the candy store and didn\\'t pay for it, but I\\'m not *a thief*! I would never rob a bank! I would never mug someone!\"\\n\\nThe fact that he didn\\'t mean to hurt you (physically or emotionally) is good, but not the only relevant thing here. It\\'s good that he accepted it and that you guys can move on. It\\'s absolutely possible for him never to do that kind of things again, and for you guys to get beyond this.\\n\\nKeep being assertive when he tries doing things you\\'re not comfortable with, and if he does something similar again, I would suggest you go away, because now he does know and wouldn\\'t have that excuse anymore. But hopefully thanks to your talk this won\\'t happen again. &gt;I\\'m not sure what the goal is\\n\\nOne syllable, begins with an \"f,\" ends with a \"p.\" How does that quote go? \"Never attribute to creativity what can be attributed to a boner.\" Let her pee first. [Nope.

That\\'s quite a long time, although it doesn\\'t mean there\\'s no chance for change. I don\\'t have any advice for you but best of luck :) Try [sugar wax](http://www.pennilessparenting.com/2010/11/sugar-waxing-instructions.html). It\\'s a lot less painful overall. Read Mary Roach\\'s *Packing for Mars*. There\\'s a pretty detailed few chapters on this - the Sparknotes version: one of the space chimps was a prodigious masturbator but didn\\'t actually jerk it in space; there was a porn that was rumored to have had one scene shot in zero-g on a parabolic flight but that was disproven (the actress\\' breasts didn\\'t float); in zero gravity your blood flow is concentrated above your waist, so space boners are actually softer than their earth counterparts. Astronauts have often used those food tubes (like, the squirty packs of applesauce) as makeshift fleshlights, but actually having PIV in space comes with its own massive limitations - it\\'s really hard to get a thrusting rhythm going without somewhere to anchor yourself. So thus far, no one has *admitted* to having successfully had sex in space - though the book was published in 2010, so that may very well have changed by now. Both make okcupid profiles and say what you\\'re after. We\\'ve had a few offers. It shouldn\\'t be too tricky if you\\'re both attractive and near a large city Especially if he already ejaculated earlier. The second orgasm will have little or no semen very few women take the pill perfectly. source: i\\'m a woman, been on oral birth control for probably 8 years or so, and don\\'t set a timer. i just take mine when i get up in the morning. this is NOT the perfect way to do it. and i probably played russian roulette with pregnancy for a while, as my ex and i didn\\'t use condoms. if there\\'s a PP that close to you, just go get some cheap/free condoms. considering i normally get up about 6 or so, and it\\'s now damn close to 10, and i haven\\'t gotten out of bed yet, it\\'s not always so close to an hour. but i\\'m also not sexually active right now, so i\\'m not super worried about it. Feeling really overwhelmed in a good way. The crying is involuntary and kind of eases the tension. Please don\\'t let her get to you. She\\'s a horrible person for doing this to you. You\\'ll find someone better. Very much a slippery slope, you want to be able to come (trust me on this, personal experience).\\n\\nWhat OP is doing does not sound healthy. Do you watch porn? in our house it is opposite... hubby is the slow cooker toys, fingers, etc I like to ask my partner what he wants, and it\\'s really just a legitimate question. There is no right or wrong answer, and I\\'m not looking for a special \"sexy\" answer. Tell me what position you want, where you want my mouth, what you want me to say, that you want me to fuck you, you want to fuck me, you want to pull my hair or slap my ass or that you want me to scratch my nails down your back... it\\'s OK if want you want is something that would happen anyway or happens every time we have sex. [from the cdc](http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/Contraception.htm) - Combined oral contraceptives—Also called “the pill,” combined oral contraceptives contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. A pill is taken at the same time each day. If you are older than 35 years and smoke, have a history of blood clots or breast cancer, your doctor may advise you not to take the pill. Typical use failure rate: 9%.\\n\\n[from planned parenthood](http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/birth-control-pill-4228.htm) - About 9 out of 100 women will get pregnant each year if they don’t always take the pill each day as directed. Oh yes. I am most definitely a leg woman- on both men and women. I also like asses and backs a lot. Buff arms, abs, and pecs I\\'m not all about. They\\'re nice but not that necessary. My SO\\'s back is smooth. He\\'s also fairly tall (6\\'4\") so he has a long back. I like the curve of it when he lays on his side, the slope of his shoulders, the dip above his ass. I really like when he is behind me hugging me, or spooning me, and when he kisses on the back of my neck and shoulders and I find myself enjoying mirroring the same behavior on him. I just have to pull him down to do it if we\\'re both standing! x = 1.15 * 10^71  \\n\\nMost people masturbate. Just because she\\'s your neighbor and you overheard that does not mean she wants to be crudely propositioned for sex with you. That would be an incredibly weird and yes, creepy thing for you to do whether she has a boyfriend or not. &gt;  If she is a cam girl, your chances of an impromptu blowjob go way up!\\n\\nNo it really, really, *really* doesn\\'t. Thank you for that little bit of rationality. He steals the pics off her phone and jacks off to them and it\\'s her fault because he saw a picture of boobs and that created mad crazy lust? That\\'s the stupidest excuse ever. No, she shouldn\\'t have violated her sister\\'s privacy either, but what he did was scummy as hell. He had no right to take that picture and if he respected his wife truly he wouldn\\'t be jacking off to her sister.  Okay...you\\'re not overreacting by being upset. What he did was a scummy thing. He stole a picture from you that he surely knew he wasn\\'t supposed to see in the first place.\\n\\nMore importantly he just gave you all kinds of insecurity issues and trust concerns that are making you nervous. You need to talk to him about those pretty plainly. Communicate how it made you feel. He absolutely disrespected you. There\\'s a difference between not being able to help getting turned on by a thought that tumbled through his head and actually acting out on something. He got caught acting out a bit of fantasy that was inappropriate. He didn\\'t have to be doing that...he chose to and others might want to say let it go, but I would at least talk about it first and find out what the hell was going through his mind that he would go that far. \\n\\nTry and work through this together. Let him know he\\'s got some major ass kissing to do and that he needs to make you feel like a fucking princess. Then when he is making up for this lapse in judgement really enjoy his efforts and relax. Maybe try to turn this fuck up into something you both laugh over and create a new honeymoon period for yourselves. Warning: May contain jizz I like to work out what order a band\\'s discography is from best to worst. Outkast, DOOM, Death Grips, QotSA, and Radiohead are the hardest to work out in my experience. A big dick is just an added bonus, IMO. It\\'s not a requirement. I would only say that being prepared for sex comes at different ages. I do know some mature 16-18 year olds who have better experiences (probably because they\\'re better informed or maybe more aware of themselves sexually) but I personally waited until I was in my 20s but it still was an awkward and slightly painful experience. I think it\\'s like what someone posted - being educated is part of the battle but it\\'s also your own comfort level and psyche that will intervene regarding the pain had during sex for the first time. You\\'re anxious, nervous etc. \\n\\nThis information posted though, I hope takes some of the stigma away and helps girls relax and enjoy their first encounter more.  Agreed. Maybe having a glass of wine or two (or three) beforehand would help her let go of any embarrassment or awkwardness in front of you too.\\n\\nHave you tried blindfolding her? Maybe that would help narrow her focus?\\n\\nAlso, she probably feels so much pressure to have an orgasm with you that it\\'s hard for her to enjoy herself because she\\'s thinking how disappointed you\\'ll be if she can\\'t.... saying something to take the pressure off, like, \"I don\\'t want you to come right now. I just want you to enjoy this,\" might help too. Or orgasm denial even? Reverse psychology?\\n\\nIt\\'s encouraging that she *is* able to climax on her own AND that she\\'s not faking it with you. Just keep the lines of communication open and let her know you\\'re not going to give up on her. This really put it in perspective for me. You\\'d have a girl go down on you but you\\'re not hetero. Once I read that it clicked. It\\'s just sating sexual desire.  Sexuality isn\\'t what confuses me. It\\'s what others define their sexuality as which confuses me. Someone the other day told me that they were heteroflexible and I was like **WHAT**? \\n\\nI\\'m not sure when orientation became complicated (not speaking of transgender folk but as in actual orientation) but I only personally understand the three original (homosexual, heterosexual &amp;amp; bisexual) but to each their own ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ \\n\\nTo piggy back off what you said though - the female body does nothing for me, but I\\'ve had several dreams involving a long haired blonde where I\\'ve had the best orgasms of my life!

What I\\'ve also learned is this:\\n\\n* having a fetish some people consider weird may not be weird at all (not going to elaborate further since this is my main account and friends/family know my reddit handle). \\n\\n* Being nervous the first time is completely normal and don\\'t expect to be amazing from the get go.\\n\\n* Buy the right size condoms (I thought they were a one size fits all type thing beforehand)\\n\\n* (personal preference) I\\'d rather lose my virginity to someone I have an emotional connection with.\\n\\n Sounds like you were date -raped (drugged) Personally, I find some of them attractive (Mark Ruffalo and Christoph Waltz are my top two celebrity crushes, for example), but I wouldn\\'t date them. wait...you say he jerking off your you assuming he is going to jerk off to them?  also....when was the last time you gave the hubby some butt? [dangling steak in front of dogs, you say?](http://stfueverything.tumblr.com/post/72348174177/bhhammy-calleo-its-like-being-presented) did you even talk to your husband?  or just assuming? If you have to ask, you can\\'t afford it... I\\'m going to guess cervical discharge.\\n\\nTo put it simply, your girlfriend produces fluids from her cervix and vagina. She also most likely has a menstrual cycle, with ovulation and periods. Over her cycle, the discharge will range from very thin and see-through, to looking like egg-white, to looking thick, creamy and white, to even brownish before her period.\\n\\nIt\\'s all normal and nothing to worry about, it\\'s just natural variation over her cycle, of her body getting ready to get pregnant, then getting rid of everything it didn\\'t need when she turns out not to be pregnant.\\n\\nThe only times you should worry is if it looks green or yellow, or if it smells really bad. Then she might have an infection of some sort. But creamy white is perfectly natural. That\\'s what I was wondering. Oh be quiet. Dan \"I wish all Republicans were fucking dead\" Savage?  Or Dan \"ignore the Bible\" Savage who called people who walked out of that assembly \"pansies.\"\\n\\n Well let me kick this off as thumbs up. Few questions. What gender are you what where they, how did this all start, what was your best memory, why did you stop? you have to change your mind set. when your not a desperate depressed self loathing virgin ladies will become interested.  CHange up your mind to say \"\"this year im going to better myself\". go to the gym eat right just go and enjoy life. and when the ladies see that your chances will be better. go on.... excuse me why i go empower myself on to her ;) brb. yes some do. some dont because they hate themselves. :) id think shes the one with the mind blowing experience and you had the penis erupting part. does anyone in school at the time know? hahah. well take it to the grave with you then! as long as everyone is safe and what not really its not that bad. good for you.  any close calls? good god man the cop. i bet you was freaking. good thing she looked young. haha you got to fake it til you make it. its not going to take a day or a week or a month. its a process. cool cop haha. by that man a beer now haha. 60% of the time it works everytime\\n It seems like half of the times I masturbate, I hit myself in the face with my own cum. I\\'m actually turned on by the fact. I hope I\\'m not the only one Honestly, I\\'ve never needed to use a condom (still a virgin) so I really wouldn\\'t know wether I am sensitive/allergic to latex or whatever the other ones are made of. *about to have sex\\n\\nGL HF (good luck have fun)\\n\\n\\n*after sex\\n\\nGG (good game) well you need to become more comfortable with yourself but he is not making it any easy for acting the way he is doing.  really, there is no way. think of how it would be like if this was flipped. \"hey yeah baby your a nice girl and all but i rather dont find you sexy anymore and you kinda turn me off bye bye.\"\\n\\nlook how that sounds. even if you do it in a nice manner there will still be hurt feelings because he likes you. sack up and just break it off with him. DO it to his face and be respectful and fully honest. he will be upset but he will in time respect you more for being up front with him.\\n\\nHow about giving the working out thing a try. you want him to look his best so work out with him. make it a team effort. Lack of experience it is then! Nope, it\\'s just a marketing gimmick unfortunately.\\n\\nSpermicidal condoms are exactly as effective as regular condoms. god isn\\'t real Yyyyyyyep. Wait and see what happens when she goes off BC. It\\'s very common for hormonal BC to suppress a woman\\'s libido. There are non-hormonal alternatives. If the hormonal change doesn\\'t help, seek counseling. well dont over think things, be more open. You do that and you will be on your way. I dont know you so i have no real clue what will work for you but you have to get over this type of thinking because i think its hurting you and your life. Dont be ashamed of whats happened or what you do its normal and its natural.  Depends on your partner. I had. My bf didn\\'t told me he was a Virgin until long after it. He just took me and banged the shit out of me. It was really hot, especially since I waited quite a bit for that. It’s just a pure-sex fantasy.  Real life people and relationships complicate this type of thing.  She likes *seeing* it, and in a way maybe she fantasizes vicariously through the actress.  She might feel titillated as though she gets to *experience* it, but without all of the real life complications of this situation. Sorry, but.. How? Are there some women that can and some that don\\'t? Or what? But I thought squirting isn\\'t peeing. I mean, I read more like a minute ago that squirting isn\\'t peeing. And, how do you go about it? Happens it after edging for a long time? Or how? Sorry, but I never really understood if you can Train that. Hahaha, oh thank you. I just always thought that squirting is something you have full Control over. Don\\'t forget a control group...also for science. I was raised pretty much the same, my mom assumes we are old enough and smart enough to make our own decisions, and she doesn\\'t mind having SO\\'s over and sex occuring in house (though the fact that I\\'m 22, and my sisters are 20 and 18 respectively may have something to do with it as well).\\n\\nI guess it\\'s also somewhat of a cultural thing. I think that in the US, because of the bigger dominance of religion, sex is more seen as something dirty and treated as such. Compare this to Europe, where most people go \"meh\" about religion, people tend to be more open about sex (at least that\\'s the image I have as a European, feel free to correct me if you feel I\\'m wrong). Most Americans I know though usually say \"wut\" when I tell them that we can just talk about sex at the dinner table (not that I have a lot to say since I\\'m still a virgin). Wikibot, pizza. i\\'m going to feel stupid if it doesn\\'t work. Normally all you have to say is Wikibot, and then something after it. I love asking and getting an honest answer, it\\'s super hot. Especially if it\\'s something I get to do to him. Rawr.  i read somewhere that the stress of not being able to grab it, might make you tense up and stuff and a good way to relax is to pop on a movie and have a snack. at the end of the movie get up and try again so my SO and I both live with out parents, being broke college students and all. we can afford getting a hotel room once a week if we split the cost. \\n\\nsoooo we end up having sex anywhere from four to seven times, roughly. over the course of a whole day. he likes to have really slow gentle sex that can last a bit longer, around fifteen to twenty minutes. but we do sometimes just go at it for about five to ten minutes and either take a break and resume a bit later, or mix it up with some hand action or oral.\\n\\ngood sex with us lasts around ten minutes, we do switch up positions a few times. longer if its a good oral session\\n\\nour situation is a bit frustrating, we both have high-ish sex drives and I would love to have sex a couple of times a day You waited for 6 years? I\\'m pretty sure for that to be possible there is something wrong here. Does it feel like you\\'re just going through the motions? Do you have desire? What sort of thing turns you on? What do you fantasize about or watch when you bring yourself to orgasm? The girl I had my first kiss with and went down on was more sexually experienced than me (she\\'s 7 years older), and told me I was great at both right off the bat. I don\\'t think she was just stroking my ego, because she kept (eagerly) coming back for more. It took me a couple of goes to get good at sex, but after 3-4 times, she said I was as good as a guy with 5+ years of experience.\\n\\nThe idea that virgins will inherently suck at anything sexual is stupid. I was HPV positive about 4 years ago. This last test revealed it had gone away on its own--so yes, that is a distinct possibility.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t go without a condom in your case unless/until your strain is gone.\\n\\nIn my last relationship, I didn\\'t use a condom, but he was the one I got it from. So. There\\'s that.\\n\\nAnd if you\\'re positive, I\\'d say something. Softball it; just ask to use a condom. If the guy gets insistent, explain it\\'s because you\\'re thinking of their health. Maybe not so strange, since it was obviously a slip of the tongue in the moment, but my last boyfriend was talking about my \"sweet, wonderful cock\" before he realized what he\\'d said. I would have laughed if I hadn\\'t been incoherent as it was. I\\'ve been surrounded by HSV1 my whole life. Both my parents and my wife, who I started dating at 18. So literally, my whole life. My parents were always very careful to never kiss me when they had an active sore and my wife and I just do the same. Been with her over 9 years now, she gets 2-5 a year it seems, and I have not gotten it. It has an impact on our relationship/sex life, sure, not kissing for a week or more can be a pain, but it\\'s worth it to me.\\n\\nBut to give my *opinion,* no, I would not consider someone obligated to tell me if they do not have an active sore. &gt; I am doing all I know how to do otherwise to let her know I am in need of attention. I buy her flowers, we cuddle a lot, I take her out to dinners, tell her she is beautiful, slap her ass and tell her she is sexy, comment on how nice she looks when she gets out of the shower...\\n\\nOkay, these are all lovely things to do for your partner, but as a woman, none of these things would necessarily signal to me that you want sex. \\n\\nWhen you are trying to initiate sex, does she *know* you are trying to initiate? Maybe you\\'re not being straightforward enough. I\\'m not saying you need to go all alpha male on her, but make sure your intentions are clear before you get frustrated with her. Maybe part of the reason she\\'s not having as much sex with you is because she doesn\\'t feel like you want it.\\n\\nHormonal birth control is another libido killer, for sure. Felt like this was appropriate\\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/oDvAD.jpg A lot of people carry it but are asymptomatic, but it\\'s not mostly men or women. I am asymptomatic but I gave my boyfriend a huge outbreak. :( Thailand.  Use your mouth.  ...what? You\\'re making this way too technical. THAT is *exactly* how people would hope their partner would respond, and that is all /u/wombative was saying.  I have a book here titled \"Swedish-Made Penis Enlarger Pumps and Me: (This Sort of Thing Is My Bag, Baby)\", by porn_theater_refugee. I\\'m the same way. I\\'ll cuddle but I don\\'t have the intense need to cuddle. I like having a little space to myself to relax a bit and let my senses wind down. Well, if you\\'re a woman, you obviously can\\'t cum from giving blow jobs. I\\'m pretty sure part of the problem is that there are two different things called squirting.  The Skene\\'s gland is responsible for some, and it\\'s not urine.  It just doesn\\'t have the capacity to account for the volume that some people experience.  By process of elimination (sorry) those cases have to be urine. Nah. He\\'s tragically 100% straight. Because that movie is amazing and hilarious and it used to make me laugh all the time in high school and oh god that was actually sixteen years ago even though it feels like just yesterday and there are women who are legal in some states who were born after it came out dammit I need a drink. One warranty card for Swedish made penis enlarger pumps, made out to... porn_theater_refugee... Talking to another guy behind my back and lying about it, kissing, the usual stuff Can we all just agree that all genitals are funny looking in general? I think that\\'s the best thing to do. Tailor sex-ed to fit the age bracket, and that way when they get older, learning the finer details won\\'t come as such a shock or be so confusing.  My parents never really talked about these kind of things with me. Questions regarding sex were usually swept under the rug with a \"you\\'ll learn about it when you get older.\" I had a book about the human body that had a section on pregnancy. The book said something along the lines of \"a woman gets pregnant when a small piece of her husband goes inside her and meets an egg,\" with a picture of a man and a woman kissing next to it. So logically, I thought this meant that a man and a woman kissed, and she bit his lip and that\\'s how she got pregnant. And my parents never corrected me on this. So I made it to 9th grade or so thinking that you could get pregnant from kissing, and I never made the connection of how sex exactly worked until a teacher took a plug and a socket, said \"This is the man, this is the woman. (*plugs them in*) Any questions?\" Well that escalated quickly... It means don\\'t pound me to the hilt because you\\'re hitting my cervix. It seems like the problem comes from how long your penis is and is probably often in conjunction with some women having shallow vaginas. Just be careful! Lots and lots of foreplay and a good lube should help. I would continue working your way up with fingers and move to toys if they are available to you. Good luck!  EVERYTHING IS THE DEVIL TO YOU, MOMMA! My mom was always honest with me. By grade 2 I knew where babies came from, that the same thing could happen with no babies too. I knew some stuff early on... my mom let me masturbate in my room from the age of 3. It\\'s kind of crazy but I\\'m glad.  That\\'s how I figured I was pansexual too! :D It bothers the crap out of me... The implication that intelligence in the adult industry is SO RARE and the handful of women who gain wider appeal are somehow magical unicorns. Most interviews I\\'ve read online, people I have met, blogs of stars, AVN magazine interviews, and the occasional radio show appearance have all lead me to believe that intelligence is not a lacking trait in porn or adult industry workers.\\n\\nThere is always a fool or two in any industry, but to treat every lady in porn as \"stupid until proven otherwise\" is bothersome to me. Asia Carrera is extremely intelligent as well. Full ride to Rutgers based on her test scores. They look like Charlotte Charles &amp; The Pie Maker :)  My parents didn\\'t teach me anything, they left it up to sex-ed at school. When my mum was pregnant with my little sister and I can remember literally thinking that the baby was in her tummy and wondering how she gave birth. I knew it came out the bottom end of the torso but had no idea how. It can be uncomfortable to only receive pleasure without feeling like you\\'re also giving it. I, at least, have this hangup to a degree (although I LOVE oral)--I know my husband enjoys giving me oral, but I can\\'t help feeling like he\\'d be enjoying himself *even more* if I were pleasuring him as well. It doesn\\'t take me long to start worrying that he\\'s not enjoying himself, that he\\'s getting tired, that I\\'m being selfish, etc. etc. I know it\\'s silly, but it\\'s easy to feel that way when you care a lot about your partner. If I understand you correctly, doggy style is okay, which means you can possibly do my favorite position. \\n\\nYou both start in doggy position, then she gets down in [this yoga-like position](http://kristinmcgee.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Extended-childs-pose.jpg). It\\'s hot and feels amazing. I\\'ve found that we can both stay in that position for quite some time, but it may not work unless you\\'re in decent shape. \\n\\nIf that\\'s too much then may I suggest playing with pillows or toys, like a sex chair. trans girls *are* real girls How is shaming someone for sharing her experience and fighting against a culture in which rape is acceptable encouraging healthy sexuality?\\n\\nGood for you, OP, for realizing you were never at fault and for being brave enough to share your story. I hope you find healing and peace. I didn\\'t bring charges against my rapist because of that. I couldn\\'t deal with the idea that he would get away and I would be dragged through the mud. She *was* saying no. With her body language. The fact that he said \"Oh my god. You think I\\'m raping you!\" is evidence enough that he noticed her consent was in question. But he continued anyway. \\n\\nFear does strange things to people. Just because they are too afraid to communicate verbally does not mean they deserve to be raped. Being raped while held at gunpoint is not the only \"real\" kind of rape. Sorry, but you *are* participating in victim blaming/shaming here. I can guarantee you Bill Gates has a guy who follows him around saying \"you\\'ve been here for eight minutes, you\\'re starting to eat your personal time.\" Of course it\\'s clear enough. it seems like everyone but me. first of all calm down. if your this freaked out your not ready. Only do it when you both are ready. best find someone you dont know but at your age that may be difficult. Look, I\\'m not a lawyer, and this isn\\'t a court case. This is a woman\\'s legitimate story of how she was raped and abused by her boyfriend. Whether you have enough evidence, based on this story, to convict her ex is beside the point.\\n\\nMy point was only that there are many ways a woman can show her non-consent, and just because verbal communication didn\\'t happen or wasn\\'t possible doesn\\'t mean the blame should fall on her. \\n\\nEven if he did think she was consenting, which I highly doubt, I\\'m pretty sure his peeing on her and verbally abusing her takes him out of the \"good, law-abiding young man\" category. Regardless of your own thoughts, I don\\'t think you need to be swearing at a victim of abuse. It really is. I found I was more physically attracted to women but with men I fall for their personalities and I find them sexy because of that. I still don\\'t 100% understand it but... I just go with it. Seems to work well so far! Mine was mostly tied to the idea (both in my head and my partner\\'s) that I had to finish for sex to have \\'gone well.\\' Once we hit that situation and talked about it and realized it\\'s just like how she doesn\\'t cum 100% of the time but still enjoys sex, most of the pressure I was feeling was lifted. I\\'m 25F and only have one (female) friend who has had threesomes. I know her most recent partners, but only through her, sooooo.. I don\\'t think they count. Are you able to get an erection during foreplay but get soft before penetration?  If so, something that helped me was having her put the condom on instead of trying to do it myself. If I tried to do it myself, that few seconds of fumbling with the package were enough to take my mind out of the eroticism of the moment and start thinking/worrying about it. If she did it for me, it was just basically a continuation of foreplay all the way up until the point of insertion with no time for nerves to get in the way. Could you explain more what about the act is off-putting to your brain? I\\'m on the other side of things from you, but I know I have a very hard time turning off my brain when I\\'m receiving head. I enjoy the sensations, but it\\'s just so hard to relax and focus on what my partner is doing. I think it\\'s because I\\'m such a visually stimulated person, and I don\\'t always have much to look at.\\n\\nSo for you, are you turned off by the mental image of what he\\'s doing, or is your brain just not engaging in the act (or something completely different if I didn\\'t get it with one of those)? Don\\'t worry about it. 19 is still young. If you\\'re not religious there\\'s no need to let it continue to affect your life.  you know it. i actually have one set up for this week though.. teehee. I think the major component that is missing here is arousal (yours). If you\\'re not turned on and experiencing pleasure, it\\'s not going to feel better than \"faintly unpleasant medical procedure.\"\\n\\nWhere\\'s the clit action? Get a vibrator going along with everything. It can change butt-feelings to WHOANELLY MY WHOLE BODY IS COMING feelings. how is it unattaInable? go get it! HAHA well life for you is not so bad. maybe one of these days as a treat ;)\\n I always did it from the beginning. there really isn\\'t any reason to be grossed out by it and sometimes condoms sometimes no condoms. Hell I\\'ve eaten my SO out during their period.  I\\'d first like to mention that you don\\'t have to enjoy anal if you don\\'t want to. It\\'s not required. There are plenty of males who like males who don\\'t like anal.  \\n\\nShould you choose to continue out of your comfort zone, the best place to start experimenting is in the shower or bath. It\\'s relaxing, warm, and relatively easy to keep free of messy mishaps. Lots of lube is important and also don\\'t expect to be able to do it at any moment\\'s notice. Anal penetration is much more enjoyable when you don\\'t currently have to poop. An enjoyable experience can take some preparation. It did but I dont read japanese :-/ and as for a specific question after washing should i let it air dry or towel it off or something?  Done. :) the nun enjoyed the seed planted inside her, as the Lord commanded. fucking awesome. It was actually the first time i ever kissed a girl so thankfully i remember it haha. It was my freshmen year of highschool and It was with the girl i had had a crush on since like 5ith grade. She was a thicker girl but had amazing tits. like im talking DDD as a 14yrold. We had a science class together that yr so one day i got the stones to hit on her. She was dating someone at the time so i had no idea if she would bite and then she did....\\n\\nI was so stocked. She told me to come over to her house after school at 3:30 (she lived down the street) and so i was there and she let me in. We went to her basement and she turned on some music and sat on the bed. I remember the song that came on the radio just then. It was 50cents Candy Shop which was super funny when you think about it but i really did not make the connection til i had left.\\n\\nWell we went at it for 15 mins or so. it was amazing. SHe let me grope her and everything. One thing that struck me odd though was that she never took her shirt off. i wanted to see those amazing tits but i never did which was a bummer but she must have been having fun  because she asked if i wanted to her to give me a BJ. I was so freaked and this was a lot to process as a young teen who has never done anything like this before. Before it went down though her mom called and told her she was coming home and would be there in 5mins. I was like DAMNIT! I had to leave but damn did i have some fun. I did not go home but went across the street from her house to my best friends and played basket ball with him haha. \\n\\nWhile we was playing she came out and watered the plants but while she was watering them she bent over in a sexual manner and then looked back at me winked and then went back inside. Was a good day. Ohhhhhhh thats what thats for thanks It was difficult for me to even pity up vote this guy. No offense, OP, I just have known way too many people who see the most obvious signs (this story is an example of an unnaturally glaring sign amongst obvious signs) that tell them to gtfo of a relationship where they decide for a variety of reasons not to do the sensible thing and would rather just cling to the wreckage like the captain of the Titanic in the movie staying with her as she sank.  I usually think about the guy I\\'m currently dating/interested in. Often fantasies about what I want him to do, or remembering what he\\'s already done. My favorite is when he teases me by rubbing the head of his cock against my labia, but refuses to fuck me directly and instead makes me suck him or he torments me with toys. Something about being forced to wait for his dick is extremely hot.... Check out /r/wicked_edge I could imagine that dudes that have had negative first experiences going down on women (or are told by their peers that it\\'s \"nasty\") would be less likely to do it again in the future. Personally I do enjoy eating pussy, but I\\'ve been pretty lucky in that the ladies I\\'ve gone down on take care of themselves. 5\\'2\" and 110 lbs checking in here.\\n\\nI love when guys pick me up and move me. It makes me feel really petite. That being said, if I\\'m trying to control the rhythm and you grab my hips and do your own thing instead, it can be frustrating. Sometimes it can be good, but if you do it every time, it\\'s not. I don\\'t, but that\\'s because I\\'ve been single my whole life. I just realized that I need to eat breakfast more often. Literally and figuratively, although being single doesn\\'t help! Why is this the default response from men? I\\'ve had it done \"right\", I\\'ve had an orgasm from it, and I still simply do not like it. I love sex, but I do not love being patronized by someone who thinks all women are the same. &gt; but would anyone give this level of praise or appreciation to a girl who\\'s eager to give a blowjob? \\n\\nI would :( Well, there currently are not any ladies that suck my dick but if there were I\\'d probably tell strangers on the internet about it. I don\\'t really talk about sex with my friends in real life. I’d also like to say that I’m sorry you had to experience this.  I happen to be caucasian too, and your story makes me feel sick as well.  I hope that you don’t feel like his behavior was normal, because I can assure you it most certainly isn’t.\\n\\nIf it helps at all, it sounds like your story happened a few years ago, and “Carl” has had plenty of time without you to *discover himself*.  In other words, I hope you don’t feel responsible for his belief choices.  More importantly, I hope you can just chalk up the lousy experience as a mistake and move on. I agree. To me it\\'s less about how great it feels physically (which is just amazing) and more about how wonderful it makes me feel emotionally. To be desired that way is a huge turn on. &gt; non-receptive \\n\\n&gt; butt sex\\n\\ntee-hee So you\\'re saying that if you have an aversion to poop, you should dig around in your butthole for poop? \\n\\nAlso, does it make me a total shitmonarch that I\\'m really surprised to find out you\\'re not straight? Dat heteronormativity.  I\\'m going to play devil\\'s advocate here: is it possible that the default attitude of *most* people in Western society who have not had things in their butts is at least a bit of apprehension? \\n\\nOn the subject of sexism, also, I think our society teaches us that women don\\'t (and aren\\'t supposed to) enjoy receiving anal sex, and that men are *absolutely under no circumstances* supposed to receive anything up there.  Both of those things do emanate from cultural sexism, but I think it\\'s possible that to the extent that these ideas get internalized by people, the OP\\'s claims on that subject represent an observation of the culture.  Well damn. \\n\\nBut seriously, how does that make sense? \"I don\\'t like poop, better get some on my finger\"?  Still, I think that\\'s probably a *little* over-much.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquiline_nose I feel very weird about this. I think it\\'s confused.. here: [Subspace (BDSM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspace_%28BDSM%29)\\n\\n[edit] lol, ***now*** it works... I don\\'t think so, personally. That tends to be the case for me. I mean, I\\'ll find other people visually pleasing, but if I am intimate with and like someone, I can pretty much only get aroused by that person just by thinking of them or seeing them. You know your boyfriend, yourself, your relationship and your boundaries. Trust yourself. Did he violate those boundaries? Is it something you can resolve? Do you feel you still can trust him?\\n If I were you I would unpack my presumptions about what it means when a girl has a one night stand.\\n\\n Your second point is so bizarre to me. My boyfriend is less likely to ejaculate on me instead of in me because I initiated the sex? If I initiate a sex act, do I then choreograph how the entire act goes? Are you suggesting women don\\'t enjoy being ejaculated on? Are we just ignoring the fact that many couples always pull out before ejaculation because it\\'s their birth control method/one of their birth control methods? Or that many couples pull out for variety and fun? Or did you mean, when a female consents to a sex act, it doesn\\'t \"end like that\"? \\n\\nI find it incredibly alarming that a police officer views a very common sexual practice like ejaculating outside of the vagina as evidence of a nonconsensual act. My boyfriend has my consent to have sexual contact with me whenever he wants, and obviously I have the power to withdraw that implicit consent whenever I want.\\n\\nI was woken up one morning by his dick rubbing against my vagina. At that point, I could have said, hey hun, I\\'m not feeling it... and he would have accepted that, no problem. Or I could do what I did, which was shift my body to allow him easier access. He did not ask my permission before he initiated sexual contact, so in your opinion, I was assaulted. In reality, he\\'s my boyfriend and he knows me well enough to know what my boundaries are, and that I would view that as a loving act and a really sweet way to wake up in the morning.\\n\\nSexual assault, at least where I come from, includes the fact that the accused had to believe they did not have their partner\\'s consent. My boyfriend believes he has my consent to touch without asking because I\\'ve told him over and over again that it is always okay. \\n\\nIt would be a sad world indeed if my experience of an extremely loving, extremely sexual relationship was considered by law to be the same as the experience of a woman raped by an abusive boyfriend. I don\\'t know where you live, but remind me never to move there. Yeah for me, girls are always a weird zone too. I was never able to flirt with a girl and her take me seriously. I looked \"too straight\" so they thought I was just being friendly. So I awkwarded out. I slept with a few girls just for fun because we were friends and we were okay with that but I never dated a girl per say. \\n\\nI don\\'t think you\\'re missing out if you\\'re happy with your boyfriend though :) it actually doesn\\'t say they\\'re planning on getting married. it says that she wants to wait until marriage, and that they\\'ve been together two years. at this point in their young lives, i hope that\\'s all that they\\'re at right now, because they\\'ve got a lot of growing to do. and i think making sure she knows she can\\'t keep his dick-dildo forever if they break up is a worthwhile conversation to have. if you can\\'t have that kind of conversation, you probably shouldn\\'t be getting married anytime soon, anyway. She IS a virgin. Depending on his size, half might be all she can manage. What. I don\\'t even like dogs. ... First of all, listen to everyone about the \"masturbate less\" thing.\\n\\nAnd then you can start to just.. relax. You didn\\'t know what to expect. No one ever does. After my first time (at 18, last year), I was like, \"so.. this is it?\" Everyone gives you the impression that sex is AMAZING. Well, it is. But you need time. Some people need more time.\\n\\nSo just relax! This doesn\\'t mean that it won\\'t ever be nice. At all! Give yourself some time. Just.. practice. ;)\\n\\nAbout the condoms now. You should try other brands and size. Some people gave good advice higher in the thread.\\n\\nAlso, foreplay. Never underestimate it. Girls have different perspectives about pornography. If hers isn\\'t in sync with yours, your only options are (1) break it off, (2) change your own behavior, or (3) hide it from her and lie when she asks you about it.\\n\\nBecause if she believes \"porn is cheating\" then she isn\\'t going to change her mind based on argument. It\\'s not a \"who is right\" issue. She feels betrayed and that\\'s her subjective response. One of my SO\\'s friends can\\'t understand why my SO is okay with me looking at porn. To the friend, it\\'s unacceptable in a relationship. Those people are out there, and you have to decide whether it\\'s worth it to you to stop masturbating to porn in order to keep this relationship. Best comment ever! Obviously you didn\\'t or else she wouldn\\'t still be freaking out. There is more to this story... talk to her.  Last time I was browsing Literotica I looked up the most read stories on the site and a *huge* chunk of them, including the most read story on the entire site, were about mothers and sons (in general incest seemed to extremely popular, with mother/son the most popular closely followed by brother/sister). So I guess people on Literotica really like it, at least. This sounds so much like someone I was involved with for a little while...met online, seemed like an awesome guy, tiny dick, talented otherwise, and turned out to be a huge douche. If you\\'re in California and that website was OkC, I\\'m going to be freaked out! lol Why are you doing the exact same thing by assuming all women think the same? It\\'s the same problem- people applying blanket statements to the other gender because they\\'re not focusing on the fact that it\\'s an issue with this specific person. I absolutely agree with this. Her reaction and the way she communicated about this and handled it was extremely poor, but it\\'s also very understandable that she was having issues due to the lack of sex.\\n\\nFor some people, that puts them in a really shitty mood- I know it puts me in a really shitty mood. It\\'s not even necessarily about the sex- it\\'s about that specific intimate way of connecting with your partner.\\n\\nI understand life getting in the way and being tired, but if you\\'re that busy, *schedule time for sex* with your partner! I agree that it sounds like she is taking a very acceptable feeling and emotion and communicating about it in probably the most piss poor way she can.\\n\\nI doubt she literally believes men are never too tired for sex- I\\'m willing to bet that she has such bad communication skills that she is just spouting off all the bullshit stereotypes that are thrown at us (men always want sex, etc.) because she\\'s unable to actually resolve her issues in a constructive way. &gt; ... by Sigmund Freud...\\n\\nwow so its totally legit\\n\\nedit: I get it everyone I mistakenly thought that everything Freud did was quack shit, but I am wrong. i plead ignorance That\\'s fine for you. For some people they need the intimacy more frequently and they can\\'t just deal with the ups and downs like that very well.\\n\\nI see the argument all the time that it makes sex less special, less fun, etc. if you plan it. Why? Why does ensuring that you have time set aside to dedicate to your partner and yourself to ensure that your needs are met make it less intimate? Frankly, as adults your life can get busy and you need to plan for things sometimes. Just to reiterate what others have said, bigger does not equal better. Seriously. Do I want a giant battering ram up against my cervix? That\\'s a big nope. Try to let go of any comparisons, because you can only be you. And you\\'re the best she\\'s ever had! So it\\'s all good. A couple of years ago, my husband (then boyfriend) was too busy with school work to spend much time with me. He was spending nights in the computer lab working with groups to get shit done before deadlines. I was packing up his stuff at finals to go home and realized his condoms had fewer than I thought they should and I immediately jumped to conclusions. I went crying to one of my friends, who asked me when I thought he\\'d ever have time to sleep with someone else, and to think about it for a while.\\n\\nIt took his roommate, who he barely got along with, telling me that he had run out and taken some from my boyfriend without  asking him, for me to believe that he hadn\\'t cheated on me. And I wasn\\'t projecting, because I definitely hadn\\'t cheated on him. \\n\\nShe\\'s young, paranoid that you\\'ll find her less desirable, and likely lonely. Humor her, and do reciprocate the gps whatnots. I hope for the best and that it all works out for you guys, one way or another.  [Sexy Sax](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaoLU6zKaws) Sounds like being overly careful and potentially still pushing really outdated info. Dude, calm down.  As others have been said, the majority of Americans have HSV-1, and many never have outbreaks.  It\\'s one of the most common, easily transmissible, and benign infectious diseases there is.  It\\'s also difficult, but not impossible, to contract HSV-1 on the genitals.\\n\\nI recently got tested for STDs including herpes since I was concerned about HSV-2.  An ex girlfriend of mine had HSV-2.  I came back negative for everything but HSV-1.  Big deal, I\\'m like most Americans.  And I\\'ve never had any symptoms.  My grandmother getting cold sores occasionally for as long as I can remember.  Maybe she accidentally infected me at some point, or maybe someone else did.  It doesn\\'t matter, and it\\'s not something I ever really think about. Show him, TELL him how much you are into him, how good he makes you feel.  Tell him how good his cock feels in you, how big it is.  Be vocal!  Whisper filthy things in his ear. She seems very insecure. She also seems to have wrong ideas about men. In her mind, apparently, men are always up for sex, so when you rejected her twice in the same day, she figured you were cheating.\\n\\nThere are definitely problems in communicating: from your post here it seems you told her in the morning \"I can\\'t in the morning, I\\'ll make it up to you later\" then you went to take a shower (often a sign for \"we\\'re about to have sex\"), and to bed, wanting a nap to rest before having sex with her... but you didn\\'t tell her that so she had already worked up herself thinking that finally, she was getting the sex she\\'d been waiting for all day...\\n\\nThe rejection was probably hard for her in the morning, since it seems she\\'s not used to it, and so she really wanted you to be into it once you were home so she could feel better about being rejected. By not letting her know \"hey I\\'m gonna take a shower and a nap, then I\\'d like to spend time with you... but I\\'m too tired right now. Wake me up in (so many hours)... You can wake me up however you want\" then not only would she had known you wanted to have sex, not felt misled when you rejected her at the last second after her hopes got high, but you could have made the whole thing sexy in its own right with her deciding how to wake you up with sex, etc.\\n\\nNow, of course you can\\'t go back in time and change it, and I\\'m not saying you were completely wrong and she was completely right - you seem more right than wrong, but you lack the one big thing of realising that whatever stresses your out, makes you tired and so on, if you don\\'t talk to her about it (whether you want to spare her or whatever), well you\\'re pretty much hiding it from her, because you guys are in a relationship where you were considering marriage, and she\\'s the one person you should absolutely be talking about this kind of things.\\n\\nSo her lack of trust, while a huge over-reaction here, isn\\'t completely out of the blue like you seem to think. You did hide things from her. You did decide not to give her details or explanations, not to keep her in the loop, whether it is because you thought it wasn\\'t important or you\\'d tell her later. But the point is that at this point, she feels like you pushed her away.\\n\\nBecause she cares a lot about you, she\\'s panicking, and as a result is pushing YOU away (you wanted to propose, and now you rightly aren\\'t so sure anymore). She\\'s trying to keep you in her life. She\\'s clumsy about it, and crazy about it, but she feels justified because you\\'re the one who\\'s been neglecting her and keeping her out of the loop (from her point of view).\\n\\nNow I get that wanting to propose isn\\'t something that you wanted her to know as this kind of thing is a surprise. But either way, here is my suggestion.\\n\\nTell her you want to have a serious talk with her. Sit down, and start by saying you\\'re sorry you\\'ve made her feel neglected and left out. That you were working extra hard because you want the two of you to be stable financially (no need to say \"so I could propose to you\"). That you should have told her and kept her in the loop of everything.\\n\\nThat you are not cheating on her, but that spying on each other in a relationship is destructive, and that you want to rebuild trust in a healthier way, by being there for her and making her see that she can count on you. That her wanting to spy on you made you feel disrespected even though you have nothing to hide, because it was a lack of trust in her part, and you want her to trust you, but you also want to feel like equals in the relationship, and her spying on you makes you feel like you\\'re under her, and spying on each other is just unhealthy.\\n\\nAsk her how you can work things out together. Tell her how long your project will take, and plan a big date together afterwards. Make plans for the days off you have and be careful about keeping her in the loop with work. Tell her you don\\'t want to push sex, but you love her and want to at least hug and kiss, and you hope you can have sex together again at some point, but you understand that if she doesn\\'t trust you, it\\'s harder to trust you for having sex, too (you\\'re inside of her, she\\'s making herself vulnerable to you, etc. Believe me, very difficult to be willing to have sex with a guy you don\\'t trust, regardless of how much you love him).\\n\\nThen make sure the situation is cleared out, that you both learned from it, that you\\'re healthier than ever. Get financially stable by working together at it. And then, re-evaluate whether you will work as a married couple. If so, propose. But only after the problems have been solved and some time has passed without other big issues arising.\\n\\nGood luck.\\n\\nBy the way, I don\\'t think she\\'s cheating  on you, and distrusting her won\\'t help anything. That\\'s exactly what she did wrong. She suspected, had no way to prove it, panicked and became very unreasonable with her demands. Don\\'t make the same mistakes. Trust her. Rebuild trust together. Don\\'t go through her stuff. Show you respect her privacy and expect the same respect from her. Yes, that is weird. There are a lot of other girls out there who won\\'t have weird sexual hangups. I suggest you find one. \"Baby, I\\'ve told you numerous times that I love you. I still do.\\n\\nI\\'ve only ever been honest with you. I\\'ve only ever been faithful to you.\\n\\nWhen you don\\'t trust me, and call me liar, that hurts my feelings.\\n\\nIt also hurts when you don\\'t support me in my efforts to create a real career.\\n\\nIf we\\'re together for the long haul, I need to know that you\\'re in it for the team -- just like I am. I\\'m busting my ass to become a winner, so that I can provide for a family... a family that you could be a part of. If you can support me through this rough period, we can enjoy the benefits together.\\n\\nBut what you\\'re doing right now is jealous and hurtful. Apologize for your behavior, and understand that this is how it is, for now. Things will be better very soon.\" For the record, SHE\\'S behaving badly and being unreasonable. You\\'re 100% within your right to refuse any of the crap she\\'s asking you to do.\\n\\nAlso, big red flag: she\\'s really self-centered. She won\\'t let you do it back to her. It hurts her that you don\\'t trust her. Why doesn\\'t that go both ways? Aren\\'t YOU hurt that she doesn\\'t trust you? She sounds very immature. Eh, I dunno, my first time wasn\\'t as painful as I thought it would be, considering the amount of foreplay involved. It was actually quite nice. I was sore the next day, but was ready to do it again the next night, no problems. If your partner is considerate and you\\'re ready to go, it doesn\\'t have to hurt.  I can enjoy it for a little while - it\\'s nice being able to fit the whole thing when it\\'s not hard yet. But if the guy never gets hard I\\'d feel like I was messing up and probably lose interest.  I know what you are talking about and it feels great for us guys, too.  She is fucking insane. Leave her immediately because she\\'s acting like an immature psychopath.  In my experience, typically the girls who freak out (especially over little things, though as others have explained, a lack of communication isn\\'t a \"little\" thing) and assume their SO is cheating are the ones who are actually cheating themselves. It\\'s just something for you to consider, since you are the only one here who can properly assess this situation because of your first hand knowledge and access to more knowledge surrounding it. She is not entitled to sex. He shouldn\\'t have to apologize to her for not wanting it. If he doesn\\'t want it, she needs to respect that. You must have never worked very hard then. Some days I feel so tired after work (and I work a standard 8-hour day) that all I want to do is sleep. Forget about having sex. Some jobs are just really demanding and suck the energy out of you.\\n\\nEither way, this girl is not entitled to sex. OP shouldn\\'t have to apologize for not wanting to put out. Having never given a blowjob, I don\\'t know what I can tell you about how you could make the experience more enjoyable for you. I can say, however, that being soft inside a woman\\'s mouth is an incredible feeling - possibly because all of my dick can fit inside her mouth at that point. It feels so good that I\\'m often happy when I can start off soft, just to have that sensation.\\n\\nNot sure if that changes anything on your part, but know that the dude you\\'re blowing is almost certainly enjoying it very much. This is one of the biggest reasons that I like to start him off with my mouth while he is still soft. It doesn\\'t happen very often, but my SO has a larger than average penis and I can\\'t fit it all in my mouth when I am going down on him typically. I love to be able to get him all in my mouth. You screwed up the communications.  Now your g/f is in crazy mode.  She\\'s holding onto her anger as she\\'s invested a lot emotionally.  She\\'s mad at you for not telling her -- she probably gets blow-by-blow updates from her g/fs about their lives, something men just don\\'t do.  She probably also worried that if you become too successful you won\\'t find her as desirable.  Part of her wants her fears validated with a break up.  Part of her wants to open up and trust again, but it\\'s difficult for women to change course once they\\'ve decided on their emotional state.  Before anyone thinks I\\'m being sexist, consider the number of women in abusive relationships who know they can and should leave but can\\'t get past their now invalidated emotions to actually leave.  It happens to men, but our culture doesn\\'t turn it into a twisted badge of honor.\\nTrust will take a long time to regain.  She has literally an ocean of anger and anxiety to cross before she can trust you.  It may never happen.  Her g/fs may take her out and look the other way while she cheats.  It gives them something to dish about when they do something stupid themselves.  You may have to take this one on the chin and move on.  Next time, listen to the passive \"hints\" women drop that mask their true feelings.  i.e. \"You always want sex in the morning\" really meant \"I want sex and you\\'re not giving it to me.\"\\nYes, relationships are 90% about the woman, the rest being whatever scraps you can get.  Your g/f could have offered to do the dishes.  She could have let you nap.  She could have asked you why you were spending so much time away.  Instead she choose to drop hints, hoping you\\'d do all of the work while she reaped the rewards.  Unfortunately that\\'s how relationships work in our country.  Keep this in mind in your future relationships, because unless you\\'re willing to drop everything and bust your butt to win her back this relationship is all but done.  Just know that she could also see you as a looser for not also busting your but and being gainfully employed once college ends drop you then. To each his own. I absolutely love it. so, bitter/sour? Are you *sure* she doesn\\'t trim it already? Be sure before you bring it up. Not all of us are Scandinavian, y\\'know?\\n\\nI was once told by a guy that he hadn\\'t gone down on me because he wasn\\'t used to \"that kind of growth\" and was used to girls who shaved or trimmed. I laughed and said he should see what it *actually* looks like. STOP APOLOGIZING.\\n\\nYou\\'ve told her why you\\'re tired, and  if she refuses to believe it, that\\'s her problem, not yours.  You have no obligation to indulge her paranoia.  Tell her to cut the crap, or GTFO. It\\'s a trap. Sounds like he\\'s finally worked up the courage to open up about what he wants, and by doing so he\\'s demonstrating how much he trusts you.\\n\\nYou find it gross, and that\\'s fair enough, but for the same reasons that it\\'s okay for you to not like whatever you don\\'t like, it\\'s okay for him to like the things he does.\\n\\nWhat you need to to is make it clear that this is not something that you\\'re comfortable with, but also that you don\\'t judge him or think any less of him for it. ...and that anxiousness/worry will ensure it *does* happen again. As a guy who has been stuck in this loop for a year now, I advise getting to it quick.\\n\\nDon\\'t worry about it, relax, stop thinking about yourself, stop thinking about your dick. Think about her, think about how great it feels, focus on the little things about her that make you just want to fuck her through the mattress.\\n\\nIf that doesn\\'t work, go to the doctors and get a couple of cialis pills, use them to break yourself out of the cycle. \\n\\nHope this helps. Next time you talk to her, ask her if she\\'d like another massage, and see where it goes. &gt; he is a super virgin\\n\\nHe\\'d have to be to miss that. I have trouble picking up signs most of the time, but even I would have seen the big red FUCK ME sign she was holding up.. Too bad she wasn\\'t wearing [one of these.](http://i.imgur.com/pNNyaBL.jpg) Do you still feel aroused by him? Do you want him to touch you? Can you get yourself off? When I met my husband, he\\'d had probably 20 different people give him blowjobs, but only one was able to get him off.  He is circumcised.  It took a few months of trying, but eventually I was able to get him off that way as well.  Back then it took 15-20 minutes of work or more.  Now I can get him to come that way in less than 2 minutes.  Crazy!\\n\\nYou might just not like them, or you might have not had a good one.  I wouldn\\'t let people stop experimenting on you, though.  My husband loves getting head now - when I met him he said he could take it or leave it.  I\\'ve only been with circumcised guys and have been able to get each and every one of them off via BJ.  I don\\'t think it\\'s a circ/not circed thing, I think it\\'s a combination of quality of the BJ, and what you\\'re used to getting off from.\\n That reasoning seems to come from no actual studies.  I know I read it because I found it easier to plant myself into the female role. Not because of agency or the like.  I\\'ll differ and say I\\'d be offended.  There isn\\'t a polite way to ask her to trim.  It\\'s an emotionally and politically charged situation.  \\n\\nI\\'ve never seen bush that gets in the way of PIV, tbh.  How could that even happen?  Is the hair so long it gets wrapped around your dick?\\n\\nThe ONLY way to bring it up is to start it as a conversation.  \"Hey, I\\'ve been thinking of shaving/trimming myself.  Is that something you\\'d find hot?\"  That would probably prompt her to ask the same of you, if she\\'s open to doing it.  If she\\'s not, she won\\'t, and if you want to keep fucking her I wouldn\\'t push it further.\\n\\nIf this is a deal breaker for you, you could flat out state, \"I\\'m actually way more sexually interested in women who trim/shave.  I love sex with you and I wouldn\\'t ask you to change your grooming habits for me, but I wanted to throw that out there to see your reaction.\"  But she might react poorly.  I would.\\n\\n(btw, I trim/shave at various times, but I resent a culture where men expect it.  take that for what you will.  but given that most women already do this, my guess that if she isn\\'t, it\\'s for a reason) this is bad advice. \"it\\'s my body, deal with it\" is entirely reasonable and not selfish when you have a casual sexual relationship with someone for 3 months.\\n this is also bad advice.  i dated a guy who tried this with me. he asked if there was anything about his body i didn\\'t find attractive.  i found him extremely attractive and said no, because that was the truth.  he pushed and pushed - \"but if you could change one thing, what would it be?\"  I finally had to admit that if i had a magic wand and could make his deep acne scars go away, that would be a thing, but i found him attractive with them.  he was deeply insecure about the acne scars, btw, and I knew this, but he wouldn\\'t let up.\\n\\nhe then used that to tell me he wished my belly was smaller.  which was the whole point of the whole conversation. we were a relatively new relationship and i had no interest in modifying my body to suit his wishes.\\n\\nyeah, that was a fight.  it was fucked up and manipulative.\\n\\ndon\\'t use that tactic. then what is the issue?  seriously.  if body hair was a boner killer for you, you wouldn\\'t be fucking her.  you\\'re just trying to control her grooming habits.  life ain\\'t a porno, son. Well, that\\'s a good thing I guess. But you can\\'t teach him how you get yourself off? Or you could possibly help him when you\\'re having sex. Just a thought. Hey, I\\'m extremely sexually adventurous (open relationship, light BDSM, threesomes, have had sex in sex clubs, etc) and I tend towards being submissive and I STILL don\\'t like anal sex!  It\\'s OK to not like it!  \\n\\nHonestly MEN should be more into receiving anal than women.  Their \"G spot\" is in their butt, but ours is in our vagina!  \\n\\nThe taboo/submissive element of it does turn me on, but the actual physical sensation (reverse pooping, but painful!) does not.  I like some anal play, up and to including small plugs, but with something dick-sized? Nope.  \\n\\nThat\\'s OK.  You like what you like.  You don\\'t have to like anal sex. seriously though, I just wrote \"reverse pooping\" before I read this.  that\\'s what it feels like!  \\n\\nI GET why guys like it - the have a prostate!  we don\\'t.  so we\\'re just left with reverse pooping.\\n Nope. I was reading kinky, naughty stuff \"suffer in silence\"\\n\\nsuffering from the natural state of a woman\\'s body that he gets to enjoy sexually?  the horror!\\n\\ni GET that people have preferences.  what i don\\'t get is why, if he\\'s into her and having sex with her, he\\'s hung up on changing her.  you don\\'t get to dictate what people do with their bodies when you\\'re casual sex buddies.  if they were in a relationship, it might be different, but then again, why would you get into a relationship with someone whose body you found repellent in the first place?  \\n\\ni fully admit i\\'m talking from a hardcore feminist stance but you know, most women out there DO shave/trim.  if she\\'s not, she probably has a reason. he can either accept her as she is, or go fuck the majority of women who do this. I\\'m kinda subby so I have enjoyed anal play from that angle but from a purely physical level it\\'s always been a combination of \"ow ow ow\" to \"wow that\\'s intense - not good, but intense\" to \"reverse pooping.\"  but mostly reverse pooping.\\n\\nit\\'s funny, my now husband was able to fuck me fully in the butt without much difficulty like, 2 months into our relationship but every single time since then has been difficult to impossible. and yeah the prep work doesn\\'t exactly make it sexier.  it\\'s something i\\'d love to be able to give him on the regular but the fact that it does nothing for me physically (and actually ranges from \\'extremely painful\\' to \\'just feels weird\\') and all the other issues...ugh.  good luck though with your experiments!  some women really end up loving it, and i\\'d love to be one of them.\\n I do this. I just have sex to enjoy it and have a good time. Even after I cum, I\\'ll keep going. \\n\\n\\nSo far, this hasn\\'t helped me being single. :/ Shame.. What you should do: http://i.imgur.com/Ml9yCHj.gif Gutterslut is apparently Norwegian for \"boys final\". Ok cool thanks Honestly, I think she\\'s way too caught up in \"males are like this, females are like that\". Not every male is the same, not every female is the same, and the risk with assuming they are is treating people in ways that just don\\'t work for them.\\n\\nAnd in her case, she just assumed things about you based on the fact that you are male rather than based on who you are as a person, and that\\'s one of the problems here.\\n\\nNow, I agree with the idea that fair and symmetrical aren\\'t the same, and that things don\\'t need to be symmetrical in a relationship, and that often it\\'s better if they\\'re not. But it\\'s a two-way street. For instance if I like loading the dishwasher but I hate unloading it, and my partner is the opposite, we each do our side of the chore rather than alternate.\\n\\nBut here she\\'s talking about you compromising on both ends and her getting her way both times. Of course you can want to protect your privacy when you have nothing to hide. You want to be trusted. You want to be respected. Sharing everything is a thing that happens, but voluntarily. You volunteer that sharing, it\\'s not demanded of you.\\n\\nI still feel that the whole GPS thing was unhealthy. Wanting you to send a text every now and then to let her know who you are might have been a compromise, if you had been okay with it, but she took it to a level of, pretty much \"I decide and you obey\".\\n\\nAs far as wanting less sex, so she should have it whenever she wants... er no. You don\\'t force your partner to have sex, that\\'s just not cool, and when you\\'re the partner with a lower sex drive, you should not only know what it\\'s like to be pressured, and therefore not do it, but also realise that whatever rejection you take every once in a while is nothing compared to the repeated rejection of your partner. Completely on your side on this one, and I think she really lacks empathy. She seems unable to realise that the way she felt that one time about being refused sex must be the way she\\'s made you feel every time she wasn\\'t in the mood.\\n\\nIn the end, I think her main problem is that she feels it\\'s the role of the man in her life to \"make her feel secure\". Insecurity is something that must be solved from the inside. You should not rely on someone else for it. And if her reaction to her insecurity is policing you more, the relationship would just evolve to get more and more restricted (you\\'d have to look away when passing women in the street, never look at magazines because there are females on them, not talk to females, etc) because she\\'d just realise whatever she does does not make her feel more secure.\\n\\nBecause even if she spies on you constantly, there are always ways you could go around it, and she\\'d never really know, and the more she spies, the more she obsesses on whether you\\'re cheating. The more she obsesses, the more terrible she feels, and the more extra barriers she\\'ll want in place to \"make her secure\". And the more insecure she becomes.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a new pattern or anything unheard of. Restriction put in place to prevent cheating only serve to make people resent each other and will drive people apart. What you need is a partner who shares your values and opinions, and then to trust each other.\\n\\nI\\'m really sorry about it all, and I wish you to get better over that break. I guess there is a tiny possibility that she will, too, and that you can get back together, but at this point it doesn\\'t seem that likely. That sucks and I\\'m sorry about that. I\\'m just going off what Google Dictionary told me. A woman of Scandinavian descent will likely have thinner, less visible, blonder, and more \"forgivable\" body hair than a woman of South American or Greek descent; even if she doesn\\'t trim, it\\'s going to be more in line with the standard of \"white beauty\" that American porn has a lot to do with. Whereas a Mexican chick (like myself) can bushwhack it and still end up with a hairier area.\\n\\nA majority of porn performers are of Anglo/European heritage and of those, a large amount are (natural) blondes. Tender pink labia and a wispy li\\'l patch of pubic hair are natural for these girls, so that\\'s now become the standard for \"normal\" genitals among the young women of Generation Porn. :\\\\ Protect ya neck. Donald Trump? Is that you? Ahh, well good! My situation was a little different...I talked to the guy for probably close to two months before meeting him, because I was terrified. He was ridiculously good looking and we got along SO well, I figured there was NO chance that he\\'d be into me when we met. But eventually we did, and he was certainly into me. Lots of fun was had, but he was pretty disappointing in the size department. It honestly just kind of made me feel like I was molesting a child, and it was a TOTAL turn off for me. \\n\\nFor a few other reasons, it just wasn\\'t going to work out on my end. I didn\\'t feel it. But I didn\\'t really know how to tell him, so we talked for another week or two before I let him know that I was interested in dating other people. He completely flipped out on me, saying I was an awful person for doing this to him, blah blah blah. And then the last text message he sent to me said \"I just wanted to let you know something because I feel kind of bad. The weekend after we met in person, I slept with another girl. I just thought you should know. Don\\'t bother replying to this, I won\\'t read it.\" LOL. What a fucking ass. 1.) He was probably lying, making him a douche that was just trying to hurt me, or 2.) He was telling the truth, making him a douche because he then has no right to yell at me for dating other people when we were most definitely NOT exclusive. \\n\\nI\\'m sorry to hear about your crappy experience :/ But definitely know that there are WAY better guys out there, I can guarantee it! If you don\\'t like it, don\\'t do it. I tried anal a few times and I am not fond of it, so my husband and I don\\'t do it. If he were super into it, I\\'d probably be down on occasion but he isn\\'t. \\n\\nI also hate hate hate hate hate cum on the face. I won\\'t allow it, I won\\'t ever try it--to me it feels very degrading and not in the fun way. I am totally ok with submission and mild rape play and all that shit but cumming on my face crosses the line between fun, sexy play and actual disrespect/condescension. My husband was sort of bummed when this came up while we were dating but he respects me and my boundaries. \\n\\nStop worrying about this--you\\'ve tried it, it\\'s not your thing so enjoy what you enjoy and have a good time. Guys moaning during sex is the hottest thing ever.  It\\'s not something I can really help. I can try to be quiet, but it takes a lot of concentration/effort on my part, and it takes me out of the mood a little. I pretty much have to make use of a pillow/ballgag/biting on my arm/whatever if I want to keep the noise down.\\n\\nNow, I am *capable* of keeping quiet--once, when I was strapped down and being teased with toys, I was ordered to keep completely silent (gasping/panting was allowed, thank goodness) for at least 20 seconds while taking direct clit stimulation. I barely managed it, but it also took a *lot* of concentration. It was actually really hot (I like being told what to do), but it did lower my arousal by a fair amount because I had to focus so hard.\\n\\nIn short... yeah, with some of us, it\\'s a very real thing. It\\'s instinctive. For some of us, if we\\'re not moaning, we\\'re probably not enjoying it as much. It all depends on the woman. Vocal men drive me *insane.* The end. There is a difference between a fuckbuddy relationship of 3 months and a marriage, for starters.  \\n\\nThere\\'s also a difference between a physical problem and a visual preference - and OP stated first that it\\'s a visual preference thing.\\n\\nHe\\'s free to ask, but if she\\'s not shaving/trimming in this day and age when it\\'s SO common to do so, my instinct is that she is doing so on purpose and he\\'s likely to get a pissed off response.  He can ask, but he might come across to her as a jerk.  \\n This is great advice and I\\'m well aware of it, I\\'ve spent way too much of my life greased up with lubes with plugs of different sizes in me, lol.  I think there\\'s just a certain size that no matter HOW many hours of prep I\\'ve had, and no matter how relaxed I am, that is just uncomfortable, and unfortunately that size seems to be smaller than my husband\\'s dick.  It\\'s the only thing that makes me sad about his dick!\\n I\\'ve personally never felt pressured to have anal sex. If a guy asks to, or even just kind of starts to mess with that part of me, I just firmly say no. Which is what you should do with *every* act you\\'re uncomfortable with. She says she\\'s worth the wait? But she\\'s never had sex? And considers what she\\'s done a lot in her first relationship at 25? I think there\\'s an issue here my friend. Yeah I am! I\\'m dating a guy right now! I wouldn\\'t be able to date two people at a time. I find one relationship takes enough of my energy nevermind two!! Plus, I don\\'t like that jealousy can become a problem quickly in situations like that. Especially if you don\\'t know both people deeply and accidentally trigger something, or if one person is introverted and doesn\\'t talk to you openly about how they feel. She\\'s into it. She enjoys it.  He\\'s an asshole.  Huge douchebag if this is normal behavior for him.  Fuck him. You\\'ve only been dating for a few months.   Your sunk cost is not that much, there seems to be a chasm between your sexual expectations that\\'s not going to be bridged anytime soon.  Move on. &gt;an assholes\\n\\nSuch a big asshole that he is no longer just one asshole, but is instead many assholes. :) Sometimes you can\\'t control your physiological responses to something- I don\\'t think it would be \"sociopathic\" or \"wrong\" of him to get turned on, but the fact that he even stated that to her, *after* making a fucked up comment about her oral sex *AND* after trying to push sex after making her upset is the really fucked up and weird part. &gt; he said not to cry or he\\'d get more turned on.\\n\\nSeriously, what the fucking fuck. This guy sounds like a piece of shit. Body hair is a big deal for some women.  For the women who aren\\'t shaving/trimming it DESPITE societal ideals, usually a very big deal.  I\\'m just being honest.  He can ask for what he wants, I\\'m telling him he\\'s not likely to get a happy response.  Nor should he, in my estimation.\\n\\n Nah, I know you\\'re right, it\\'s a combination of my lack of intiative to push it further and my husband\\'s laziness with doing the whole \"today this plug, tomorrow the bigger one\" etc thing.  I\\'ve told him I\\'m willing to work with it if he\\'s willing to put in the time, but since it doesn\\'t do that much for me and he seems to only want it in the moment, it remains a stalemate.  Someday if he\\'s really into it, he\\'ll do the work to get us there.  \\n Just FYI, this sort of contact is a plot point in the whole fifty shades of grey fad the ladies were all swooning over.  D\\'aww. And Reddit comes full circle once again. You two are precious. Congrats on your achievements! I don\\'t think there\\'s really any one/right answer. I think it\\'s different for every couple, and different for them every time. My boyfriend and I can pull off a 1-3 minute quicky before work or on a lunch break... or we can go up to an hour (or two+). The timing varies just as much as our positions/location/lighting etc.  right?!?! SF bay area has a few public sex clubs.  The one we went to was like, a weird sex-positive Burning Man offshoot.  You have to go in costume based on the theme, there\\'s musical acts and bursleque shows, a couple bars, and a room in the back for sex.  But it was weird, there were all these rules.  We went because we were invited by a guy we were thinking about hooking up with.  My now-husband was fucking me while I was having a conversation with the guy, and they threw him out because apparently that was against the rules?  I tried to say I was cool with it but apparently not.  I actually didn\\'t find it all that hot, but I\\'m just not an exhibitionist at heart.  I\\'m glad I did in a \"checked off THAT box!\" kinda way but I have no desire to go back.\\n\\nAnyway, I feel you.  I have a hard time seeing anal as anything but a submissive act, tbh, which maybe isn\\'t fair - I am sure there are couples for whom it\\'s not - but it really feels that way for me.  And being subby I LIKE that part of it, unlike you.  But physically I don\\'t like the sensation of it.  Even when it doesn\\'t hurt/feel uncomfortable, at best it feels \"just weird\". On a physical level I don\\'t understand how other women find PIA pleasurable.  I can get off like crazy via rimming while using a toy, or having a small plug up there while doing PIV, but an actual decently-sized dick?  Nawww.  \\n\\nI feel kinda bad because I want to like it, but I just don\\'t, and I\\'m OK with that, too.  I\\'ve told my husband that if he really wants to get his dick in there we can keep having long sessions with the tons of lube and graduating to differently sized plugs but so far he hasn\\'t put in that amount of effort and I\\'m not gonna ask for something that doesn\\'t do anything for me.\\n &gt; he said not to cry or he\\'d get more turned on\\n\\n&gt;he hopes I feel bad\\n\\nIf this is real, this is insanely unacceptable. Normal people don\\'t treat others like this. He sounds like he has a personality disorder. 2 usually. Me on top then him on top. Sometimes we\\'ll try other things, but we are so goddamn uncoordinated so we tend to stick to our tried and true methods. LOL! Feral Hoodrat. Love it :) I couldn\\'t bring myself to have sex with the guy, or even really give him a full hand job. I don\\'t have huge hands or anything, but my hands didn\\'t fit comfortably around him because he was THAT small. Such a turn off. \\n\\nI stopped online dating after that. He was really the only guy worth a damn I met there, and he turned out to be scum, so I was pretty much turned off from it. I basically used online dating as confirmation that I was still attractive after a horrible relationship left my confidence in shambles. It was good for that purpose, although I\\'m pretty sure any girl gets tons of attention online. Do you guys use condoms? For some guys that really decreases sensitivity, and that mixed with the death grip problem could be really detrimental. My guy had both of those problems. He\\'s pretty much solved the death grip problem, but the condom is still an issue. Why on earth are you having unprotected sex? (sorry for not addressing the actual problem, all I have to say about that is just wait to see the doctor) Haha okay glad you\\'re using a form of BC that\\'s what I was concerned about\\n\\n\\n(p.s. there are a lot of places that you can get free condoms! Health centers/clinics or at school) He did the same thing as your bf - he stopped masturbating for a few weeks. Now he only does it with lube and a much looser grip. I think the problem was the \"dry\" masturbating thing, because it\\'s a completely different feeling than actual sex. So if your bf doesn\\'t use lotion/lube he should try that out Untreated mental illness is a tragedy. I\\'d lean more towards a yeast infection. A UTI wouldn\\'t generally be visible since it\\'s an internal infection. And it\\'s a bitch. The symptoms would be pain while peeing, blood in her urine, burning, ect. So to me it sounds most likely to be a yeast infection - which often would be outwardly visible.\\n\\nAlso yeast infections/UTIs are extremely common for women. One way to prevent a UTI is peeing immediately after sex. I don\\'t know too much about yeast infections but I\\'d google how to prevent those because if she has it once she\\'ll probably get it again. Oh great, [this](https://pay.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1u36jp/girls_on_reddit_what_are_your_sexual_experiences/). [question](https://pay.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1pcg2s/what_is_it_with_girls_and_being_freaked_out_by/). [again](https://pay.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1v6753/aesthetically_perfect_penis/).\\n\\nSimple answer: circumcision is very common in the US, so women from the US are more used to it, and are probably more likely to prefer cut. Outside the US: (ie. the *normal* part of the world), circumcision is very uncommon, so non-American women probably prefer uncut.\\n\\nThat said, it still comes down to personal preference. I am Australian, and all the girls I have been with have never seen a circumcised penis. But, I was on OKCupid and looking at an Aussie chick\\'s profile, and all was good until the very bottom where under \\'message me if\\' she had \"only if circumcised\". Very unusual here.. Regarding name-calling, ask her (in a non-sexual setting) what names she ***doesn\\'t*** want to be called, and call her *every other name* you can think of. As /u/Oasys12 said:\\n&gt; Like a fucktoy that\\'s only there for your pleasure. Stop caring about pleasing her and just do what YOU want\\n\\nExactly this. She wants to be submissive and feel used. So use her.\\n\\n---\\n\\nRegarding what you said:\\n&gt;she told me that she likes the idea of being \"objectified\" in bed. This goes against her personality and opinions very much\\n\\nWe all have fantasies and desires that defy our normal thought processes. This is one of hers. Nothing too suprising there. Plus, some of the more kinky girls I have been with are also some of the most plain &amp; gentle girls outside of sex. It\\'s always the quiet ones.... Erect. And for two reasons:\\n\\n* Size can vary while flaccid due to a number of reasons, including termperature, where as erection size fluctuates much less.\\n\\n* Penis size is generally only relevant during sex, when it\\'s erect, so it makes sense to therefore measure it based on it\\'s condition when used. /r/xart /r/homemadexxx\\n\\n/r/xart A bunch of people who were told by a friend that she got saw dust in her eye at work now know the truth... I think you missed the joke.. I was having sex without condoms long before I knew I had phimosis.. Never had issues.\\n\\nMy foreskin didn\\'t retract inside her back then, mostly does now when erect, but not all the way. I can feel \"tugging\" pressure during sex, but my foreskin\\'s long enough and has enough slack that it doesn\\'t hurt. No pain ever, unless I pull it back myself too far/hard.\\n\\nTry it and go gentle. You should be fine. &gt; Read that real fast as \"she\\'s 15\"\\n\\nSame. Need sleep. (nearly midnight here in Aussie-land) Di... did you? Multitasking can be a bitch during sex... This dude is a prick. Dump him. Find a man who loves you enough to wrap it. You\\'re not being unreasonable for wanting to protect yourself from pregnancy and STDs. \\n\\nI personally don\\'t use hormonal BC because it disagrees with me, I struggled with weight gain, loss of libido, mood swings, headaches- the usual things gals get if hormonal BC doesn\\'t work for them. It\\'s not a big deal, just look into a copper IUD or use condoms.\\n\\nMostly though, dump that immature fuckwit. I\\'m with him/her on this. Tears rolling down her eyes because she\\'s deepthoating like a champ? I get that. Sexy. But her crying because he hurt her feelings and that turns him on? totally different...   \"If you make me come again I\\'m gonna marry you so hard.\"\\n\\nThis was three weeks into the relationship. She realized what she said and was immediately embarrassed, but we\\'re able to laugh about it now. And a merry D-Day to you! I cringed. My girlfriend is really into puns. Once I was nibbling on her ear and it was turning her on like crazy (which is surprising, she usually isn\\'t as into it), she referred to it as \"aural sex.\"\\n\\nBut then later when we were having more standard-style sex, she told me, \"I\\'m so into you.\" I replied, \"I\\'m really into you! Literally, at the moment...\"\\n\\nWe\\'re horrible. I was giving a guy a handie (which I can admit I\\'ve never been really good at) in the middle of it, he leans in and whispers in my ear \"Were you a carpenter in your past life?\" \\n\\nI was hoping he was making some \"Wood/Boner\" joke so I asked him \"Why?\" to which he responded \"Your hands are just really rough.\"\\n\\nFucked me up for life.  NEAT As a few other people have said, probably not actually in a wheelchair because that seems a bit uncomfortable- there\\'s got to be other, better, positions.\\n\\nBut, yeah, why not. I want to fuck, not walk. That\\'s what I said?  I was married for 6 years to a man with a very small penis. We had a good sex life.  he has small hands, and you know what they say about guys with small hands...\\n\\nthey have small gloves. OP MUST DELIVER He was about 3 erect. Not married anymore because he had an affair with my friend.  Seconded He was great at oral. Rarely used toys. what was the smell? Seriously. I noped the fuck out.  I think he thought he was being sexy or something. He was using his best Barry White voice. Dafuq?  How\\'d you get with her? I\\'m curious. This is the funniest thing I\\'ve ever read.  Doctor. \\n\\nMine would be tight and uncomfortable 50% of the time. That is until one particularly rigorous escapade where snapped my banjo. Not an experience I would recommend. \"I really wanna have sex with you.\"\\n\\nMid-coitus.  He was rather drunk. I\\'m sure this will get buried, but you know what stood out to me?\\n\\nHe thinks married people have bad sex and no-strings sex is better and more exciting. He actually *told you* sex is better during a one-night stand than in a committed relationship.\\n\\nNot relationship material, this guy. Even if his abusive behavior changed or got no worse, that\\'s still a red flag that he\\'ll cheat. You are not helping, homeboy. Was this woman Mr. Garrison from South Park? She\\'s probably just a /b/tard That\\'s what all my friends told me. \\nI mean, I knew I sucked at handjobs anyway. I feel like a guy can do it better, but I give a mean Blow Jay.  Nothing will make a girl freak out like that statement! Lol Grandpa?  Fake a punch to the face\\n\\n\"Two for flinching!\"\\n\\nThen you really deck her in the face Holy. Shit.\\n\\nIf it\\'s giving you horrible side effects, why are you putting yourself through it? \"Oh yaaaaa, let\\'s go halfsies on a bastard!\" Well that relationship escalated quickly Commenting to find later  \\n\\n&gt; I think he missed a wonderful opportunity -- if it was a kink, anyone forward enough to bring it up that early and suddenly has a high potential for being a lot of fun. \\n\\nYou my man are wise beyond your years. With girls like that, you suck it up, throw on the diaper once then make her do all the kinky shit you\\'ve always wanted to do! That\\'s pretty much the New Zealand equivalent of \"oh ya fuck me harder babe!\" And then I noticed your username... No probs. That\\'s better then \"You\\'re numberrrr ehhhh shiiiit I lost count...\" lol Apparently she really loved the D. Even if you take a more progressive stance on women\\'s sexuality, losing your virginity to a very experienced girl can be a bit intimidating  And calling it \"supper\". Either midwesterners or senior citizens, I\\'m guessing?  Haha, you\\'re giving me serious flashbacks to an old SO.  She loved: \"Fuck-slave\", \"Fuck-toy\", \"cock-sucker\", me telling her her pussy/ass was mine and I was going to use it however I wanted but as soon as I slipped a \"Bitch/slut\" in there she would stop and be like \"I\\'m not a bitch/slut :(.\"  \\n\\n\"I know!  I totally don\\'t think you are one!  You know...dirty talk :(.\"\\n\\nBut yeah you don\\'t know how difficult cherry-picking your diction during a hardcore fuck-session can be until you\\'re actually in the moment =X. We\\'ll be moving in together in October hopefully. Baby steps man! You must have hands as soft as Falcors fur. Good on you lady carpenter, good on you. \\n\\nEdit: I am wee todd it.  Women imagine men have really coarse hands, and are pleasantly surprised when they don\\'t. Unless they are women who like \\'Real Men\\', in which case, they are calling you a pussy who never did a real day\\'s labour in his life. The way to a mans stomach is through his boner.  Hahaha you\\'re not too far off I personally don\\'t see it as being too unreasonable. Things can get real sore down there for a woman if you\\'re pounding at it for that long. Find other ways to finish if you really need to finish. Either you do it manually or have her blow you or something. I know it\\'s not exactly the same for women and men, but do you realize that this is what like 50% (if not more) of women deal with? Sex is over for us once he finishes.\\n\\nI don\\'t mean for this to sound harsh, and I think you definitely have a right to feel this way, but I don\\'t think she\\'s wrong.\\n\\nIf you want you try ways to make yourself finish sooner - quit masturbating for a bit or loosen your grip when you do so. penises are dildo shaped........ •_• Didn\\'t happen.  I didn\\'t either 0_0 I thought this was /r/askreddit\\\\! Taking more than 10 minutes of PIV can be painful for many women due to chafing. \\n\\nEasy improvement #1: buy some nice lube and reapply it frequently. If you don\\'t use condoms, I recommend coconut oil. If you do use condoms, I recommend a nice silicone-based lube - it won\\'t dry out like water based. \\n\\nEasy improvement #2: have her tease you for a long time before PIV starts. This might help you cum faster. \\n\\nEasy fix: if her pussy is sore, ask her to finish you with her mouth. \\n\\nLess than ideal: masturbate after she\\'s done. You can make this intimate by doing it while kissing her or cuddling with her. \\n\\nThe fact that she feels objectified is much more concerning. If she\\'s totally uninterested in sex after she cums and you keep fucking her for much longer, maybe you _are_ objectifying her - but why would she be uninterested in making you feel good? You need to have a serious conversation about this. \\n\\n &gt;  he looks online and goes \"damn too small\" \"oh that would never fit\"...I know he means only the best and would never say anything mean to me\\n\\nYou\\'re right, I\\'m sure he wouldn\\'t say those things if he knew they hurt you. He probably doesn\\'t realize they hurt because he thinks of your size as a good thing - he is attracted to you, after all. He hasn\\'t experienced the years of conditioning \"big=bad no matter what\" that every woman has. Perhaps you should talk to him about how his words make you feel - he should know! \\n\\nI can\\'t help you with finding latex, but I just wanted to say that you have an awesome figure! I\\'m a skinny little thing, size 0 and XS in everything, and my waist is 25/26 inches - barely smaller than yours - but my hips and bust are both over 10 inches smaller than yours, and people call my figure an hourglass... You must be some kind of Christina Hendricks godlike thing.  what littledeerfawn said, make sure you are cleaned out before the act  I know, I was trying to hit a few perspectives. None of those things is anyone\\'s fault. It\\'s just interesting to look at how it is perceived when you reverse the genders. I\\'m not too great with words so I wasn\\'t sure how to put what I was trying to say. Still not too sure I\\'ve made myself clear haha I would check out Strictly Sex with Dr. Drew where he actually talks about how that sugary doesn\\'t really work Haha when I make a rockin meal for my boyfriend he flat out tells me he\\'s going to break me in half tonight. In a sexy way. It\\'s the perfect storm of sexy and sweet and ego-stroking and subspace-inducing. *guh* No, we definitely don\\'t. Well, the rest of y\\'all don\\'t, I should say. I  do call it \"supper\" when I talk to my kid for some reason. Probably because that is what my mom and grandma said to me. My homeland is Chicago by way of southwest Missouri and I guess you can take the girl out of the midwest, but you can\\'t take the midwest out of the girl. Or something. My friends make fun of my accent because it is a weird hybrid of Chicaaaaago and Missourah. So, yeah, in Colorado it is lunch and dinner, not dinner and supper.   First of all, no. No no no. I was saying girls very rarely have orgasms, not that they expect a man to. As in 50% can\\'t even have one via sex. Also, why would you assume it means she is failing? I don\\'t agree with anything you\\'re saying. PREACH. This entire thread is laugh-a-minute dense about how entitled it sounds. *But men ALWAYS get to come!!!!*\\n\\nWelp, I am a big fan of everyone getting their cookie, but damned if it isn\\'t just crowed up and down, loud and clear, that people (read: women) should be happy with closeness and intimacy instead of getting theirs. It\\'s one of the old saws of /r/sex that I have never been able to get on board with.\\n\\nAnyway, buddy has death grip probably and needs to learn to come from lighter stimulation, and his girlfriend IS being too dismissive, but jesus. This shit is hilarious. Nope, it changed again. PAPs every 3 yrs &amp; no testing. Too many false alarms.  Do you know?  They won\\'t test you if you\\'re under 30, and there is no widely marketed test for guys. \\n\\nYou have no idea if you have it or not and doctors *assume that you do.*  that\\'s how prevalent it is.  Vaccination only protects you from 4 strands out if 100. 2 that cause most warts, 2 that cause most cancers. You can get HPV even with the vaccination because it is NOT meant to protect against HPV, just the cancer-causing strains.  I just don\\'t enjoy water based lubes. They dry out my skin and cause more chafing than would have occurred with no lube. Silicon based lubes basically lock my skin\\'s moisture in - they don\\'t moisturize, but they protect my skin from drying out. They require a bit of cleanup, but they\\'re slippery and compatible with condoms (but not toys). And then, the best of them all, oil based lubes. They moisturize my skin while being slippery and transferring body heat during sex. They\\'re compatible with my body\\'s pH - many water based lubes and some silicon based lubes can cause yeast infections, in my experience. It isn\\'t compatible with condoms, but I\\'m in a fluid bonded relationship so I don\\'t care. Coconut oil just goes into my skin and makes me feel like a goddess. And now my bed smells like coconut oil. And so do my lover and I.  It depends on the girl. Some girls like to go for 30-60 minutes. Most of us like it more like 10-20 minute range. For some more sensitive girls, ten minutes might be the upper bound. Personally, I can go for hours at night, especially if I have a glass of wine in me, but in the morning, I get sore after 5-8 minutes.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_lubricant#Silicone-based Hrm, a bunch of people keep saying that... maybe it\\'s that silicon based lubes are not okay with latex, but you can use them with polyisoprene? I\\'m allergic to latex so I only use polyisoprene condoms, and wouldn\\'t have paid any attention to whether my lube could be used with latex condoms.   I said it is fucked up how he behaved, not sure where you\\'re getting your stance on this. I only commented on a physical response. I think his actions were pretty disgusting. I\\'m 47 years old. I have spent my teenage years and my adult life paying the price for assholes like this. The collateral damage they do is incalculable. \\n\\nI don\\'t know you. I won\\'t ever meet you yet i can say this without a moment of hesitation: You are worth more than he could ever offer you.  Anyone that believes they have the right to do something to you that they wouldn\\'t explore themselves is a shitty and inconsiderate lover. Anyone that uses sex as a weapon, such as using it to \"putting you in your place\" is a coward. \\n\\nAnd you\\'re too bright and too beautiful to let someone like that to drag you to their level.  I would be curious to know what type of therapy you have pursued. Traditional talk therapy is probably not going to be super helpful for such a traumatic event, especially because now there are compounding issues on top of the original assault. Do a little research about E.M.D.R., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or even Prolonged Exposure therapy. Also, the Emotional Freedom Technique (E.F.T.).These therapies are geared more specifically towards trauma. \\n\\nAlso, I know this sounds corny, but write a letter to Dan Savage. He is a wise, wise man when it comes to tricky situations like this concerning sex and relationships. I know you have gotten a lot of good feedback here, but this is some pretty major stuff you are talking about. May be a good time to bring in some professional advice. \\n\\nWhat a horrible thing for you to endure, and I know it must be painful for your sweet husband to not be able to help you.  I really wish for the best for you both.  It depends on the girl! You should talk to her about it. I\\'ve been out of commission for a day or two after fantastic sex. I\\'ve also been out of commission for a few days because someone lasted way longer than I wanted and my pussy is raw.   It might not be 100% condom size at play. It also sounds like there\\'s more lubrication inside the condom than outside. Try condom safe lube Talk to a doctor. Your dick sounds like mine was at 18. I can comfortably retract now, but that is in part from stretching and in part from a significant tear one day. I\\'d been having sex for about 8 years at that point though, if its any consolation  Hormonal birth control is very effective. Its typical use failure rate is much lower than that of condoms, per http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/unintendedpregnancy/contraception.htm\\n\\nPill packs always come with instructions that tell you when you would need to use additional protection, for instance when first starting BCP or if she misses a pill. Setting a phone alarm is a good way to ensure she doesn\\'t miss a dose if she is worried about that. There are also other methods of birth control (IUDs, implants, Nuva Ring, etc.) that take remembering to take a pill out of the equation.\\n\\nHormonal birth control prevents ovulation, so there shouldn\\'t be any \"high risk time,\" ever, unless she misses a dose or two.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the only time you would need to use condoms as backup is if she is just starting birth control after being off it for a while. But she\\'s obviously nervous about not using condoms, so you need to talk about it with her. Make sure you both understand how birth control works and that she is comfortable with everything before switching to no condoms. If she is terrified, bareback sex is not going to be good anyway.\\n\\n**TLDR:** You probably don\\'t need to use condoms, but if your SO is terrified of sex without them, you might want to anyway.\\n When I don\\'t come, I feel an aching hollow inside, I am wound up and tense and frustrated and aroused and tingly and angry and did I mention frustrated. Women have \"ladyboners\" -- blood flushes all the sexual extremities -- and having that tension sit instead of being released is uncomfortable and maddening.\\n\\nBeing left hanging is shitty for everyone, male and female. And yet there are vast multitudes of women whose sexual experience is *majority* zero-orgasm. They just deal with it and appreciate the intimacy and closeness. I think that\\'s bullshit and they should be more empowered to get theirs, with his help optimally, without if necessary... but that opinion aside, given how uneven the scales are, I cannot cry too hard about a man not getting his occasionally. 30 minutes is too long (wut?) and she went from wanting you to get off to not giving a shit. The problem is her personality. Good luck changing that. Talk it out or find a new girl. Just because it happens to women doesn\\'t mean it should happen to everyone. Everyone deserves to get off! Are we also forgetting that his girl has 6(!!!) orgasms in ten minutes? That\\'s crazy.\\n\\nAnd if a blowjob is the answer then I\\'d like to meet OP\\'s wonder-girlfriend. \\n\\nSorry, but this is just bad perspective and bad advice all around. They need to work together to find a compromise, not blame one another or play the sexism game.\\n\\n\\n\\n Then those chicks should dump their loser boyfriends. She\\'s not seeing it anywhere. hahaha Get a motorcycle. You and OP\\'s girl should hang out. I feel it up in my guts, like I jumped on a bicycle with no seat. The relationship you describe with your guy seems very open and caring to me. I\\'m not picking up that vibe from OP. Listen to this internet stranger, they know what they are talking about. Trust me, I\\'m an internet stranger too.\\n\\nButt seriously, you have no reason to feel bad. Well since you didn\\'t give us any information at all about yourself or your situation, not even your gender, it\\'s virtually impossible to give you any advice.\\n\\nIf you want information resources, check out the [/r/sex wiki/FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index). It\\'s packed with incredibly helpful information about pretty much anything you could want to know about sex. Knock yourself out. Gotta gauge your bf\\'s self esteem. If my gf gave me this video i\\'d be thrilled, id have a blueprint to pleasing her. But i wouldnt give a video like this to her I watched my gf have sex with a girl the other night, if that counts. Im a male. \\n\\nHoneymoond period. 32m, 26f. No jealousy, i dont get jealous about girls. I thought the whole thing was fantastic.\\n\\nI couldnt watch her with a guy though. Guys dont deserve her :) &gt; going off on long winded explanations\\n\\nAs an aspie, I go off on long winded explanations all the time, but people tend to find it annoying... oh well. I think it\\'s fantastic, especially if I get to have a taste :D &gt;and i\\'m not going to have sex with folks who have STDs.\\n\\nGood luck.  If you\\'ve had sex with multiple partners without rigorous, repeated testing, you most likely had sex with someone who has an STD.  ~85% of the ~20% of the population with HSV-2 aren\\'t aware they have it. This is a terrible answer. Given that pretty much the entire population has some form of herpes virus, you might as well advocate that nobody ever kiss or have sex again. Just not reasonable. Same here. We wash our sheets every other week, or swap them out at least. If we\\'re going to be doing something especially messy, we lay down a towel. We also keep a towel beside our bed so we can wipe lube off on it. :D I tend to go on rants about subjects that interest me and I have an accent. Maybe that\\'s not such a bad thing, after all. &gt;I don\\'t have herpes. My girlfriend doesn\\'t have herpes. Neither of my parents have herpes. Either of my four brothers don\\'t. Your exaggeration has no valid point. EVERYONE does not need to stop having sex. That\\'s a stupid thing to say. You\\'re consenting to an idea of the \\'spreading\\' of herpes. \\n\\nEver had chicken pox? Shingles? Cold sore? Herpes, spread like herpes, just on different places on your body.\\n\\nYou\\'d be darn surprised who has herpes in your life. Estimated 80% has a transmittable form of Simplex. Those tests are *extremely* unreliable. So unreliable that my doctor tells me they\\'re a huge waste of money, you know you have it if you present, and sometimes you don\\'t know you have it if you don\\'t present.\\n\\nHis advice: live normal, and be responsible when you have symptoms. Feel free to Google \"asymptomatic herpes\" and see for yourself. Hmm, a man can dream.. :D I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever seen better advice in this subreddit.  My boyfriend always goes off on these tangents about all these really specific economic and political issues. I\\'m conversant on those topics, but he\\'s incredibly passionate and articulate about them and I love just watching him go on and on about retirement pensions or retiring the carriage horses in Central Park. (I think it all goes back to having all those early sexual fantasies about Sam Seaborn. Men who talk like pre-Studio 60 Aaron Sorkin characters just get me going like nothing else.) When my bf talks about his games/comics/music/shows/movies he likes and shows me examples and tries to get me involved in what he likes... mmmph. It\\'s just such a good feeling. Sometimes I\\'ll be naked on his couch and he will keep talking to me, eye to eye about what he loves it\\'s a turn on. He respects me AND wants me to enjoy things with him? I likey. when my SO and I have sex theres lots of fading in and out of sex. like we will start with PIV and just kind of end up at oral then one of us might need to pee and then we cuddle for a bit then theres fingering and then sex again, and thats pretty common with us. \\n\\nso, to answer your question, no I dont care at all. sex is about having fun and feeling good, not about pushing yourself to orgasm every single time.\\n\\n A former SO used to play with the seams of my jeans when we hung out. I do not know why, but the mindless fidgeting/touching seemed sexy-sweet to me. I asked her about it once and she said she liked how it felt under her nails and it gave her an excuse for constant contact without being too \"touchy.\"  I have caught myself doing it a few times too for contact. I am more of a lint-picker-offer though. Ha &gt;Whether \"extremely unreliable\" is true or not, nothing changes the fact that it\\'s unreasonable to assume *everyone* has it. Regardless, people can at least realize that \"it\\'s not a big deal\" is very much a personal decision.\\n\\nI agree, but giving the advice \"never\" is the opposite of personal, and I dint condone it given the circumstances.\\n But with semen. I\\'m a female, and I feel the sexiest when I\\'m covered in flour after a day of baking. I\\'d love to find a man who thinks like you!  Wait, I\\'m pretty sure that means like at least 50% of the (developed country) population is fucked in that regard anyways because of the prevalence of oral HSV-1.  Which, unless you\\'re willing to go to *extreme* lengths, is pretty hard to avoid.  And that\\'s assuming you didn\\'t pick up the disease as a child before you even knew what the fuck Herpes was, which most people did.\\n\\nAlso, the new targeted antivirals (e.g. Valtrex) seem to help significantly according to your link.\\n\\n&gt;With the development of specific antiviral agents, it is now often possible to maintain the level of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. The drug of choice against CMV is intravenous ganciclovir. Under conditions of ganciclovir resistance or a failure of ganciclovir treatment, foscarnet or cidofovir is often used. Foscarnet is also given intravenously but has several serious side effects, including nephrotoxicity, nausea, vomiting, anemia, and seizures (52). Cidofovir, a nucleotide analog of cytosine, is not herpes specific and has activity against several other viruses, including adenovirus, hepatitis B virus, and human papillomavirus (102). Its use is limited by significant nephrotoxicity.\\n\\n&gt;Valganciclovir and valacyclovir are newer drugs currently under investigation for treatment of CMV disease in transplant recipients. Both drugs can be administered orally and have increased oral bioavailability compared to that of acyclovir or ganciclovir (60). The effective use of oral antiviral agents for both prevention (valacyclovir and ganciclovir) and treatment (valganciclovir) of CMV disease would represent a significant improvement in CMV disease therapy among transplant recipients. However, the ease of administration of these drugs also leads to a substantial risk of inappropriate overuse and increased viral resistance. Even in the accounting program I\\'m probably the only person who finds accounting exciting. And effective, too. It does on me.  She sounds like a bitch. I agree. It seems more likely that your period is late for another reason (for instance stress, due to worrying that you\\'re pregnant).\\n\\nIf your period is irregular to begin with, and last time was around Christmas (so, on the 25th or so, and it\\'s the 29th now), it\\'s honestly not that late... If you\\'re really worried get a pregnancy test, but chances of it being positive are abysmal.\\n\\nJust be more careful in the future, use condoms, and remember getting pregnant is not the only risk when not using condoms. He looks at other women and find them attractive because being in love with you does not turn off people\\'s senses. That does not mean he loves you less, or finds you less attractive, or that he\\'d want a relationship with any of the other girls/women he likes.\\n\\nThink about movies or books you\\'ve seen or read. Have you never thought a guy was cute, dreamy, romantic, etc? That doesn\\'t mean you don\\'t love your boyfriend, just that hey, this guy in this story is hot, too.\\n\\nThe only relationships I know of where neither partner finds anyone else attractive are relationships between asexual people, who don\\'t experience sexual attraction.\\n\\nHe\\'s right to say he can\\'t control it: it\\'s like asking him to stop thinking his favourite food tastes good, or to stop enjoying the smell of food cooked by someone who isn\\'t you.\\n\\nHe can control his action, and if it makes you insecure that he tells you about who he finds hot or sexy, then you could ask him not to tell you. Just be aware that it\\'s not going to turn off his thoughts.\\n\\nTake a deep breath and remember that he\\'s chosen to be with you, and not with any of these other women you mention. He has a sex drive and that sex drive will be triggered by other people. That\\'s normal. But you\\'re the one he wants a relationship with, because you\\'re the one he loves (on top of finding you attractive).\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t seem to be very understanding, and that\\'s a shame, but the truth is, there probably isn\\'t much he could say or do to make you feel less insecure. Unless he\\'s actually neglecting you, that is. Yes, he should be there for you, hug you, kiss you, say he loves you and that you\\'re beautiful. But expecting him to stop looking at other people is unrealistic, I\\'m afraid.\\n\\nTry and plan a date together for him to make you feel really special. Tell him you\\'ve been feeling down and you want to feel beautiful and loved. Maybe that will help. Great movie. Sad, but great. I\\'m sure what you\\'re feeling is her cervix--6\" is definitely enough to reach it. The anterior fornix, which might be what feels good to her, is between the cervix and the front wall of her vagina, so you are likely feeling her cervix when you stimulate that area. I\\'m pretty sure a UTI wouldn\\'t develop to the visible-blood state overnight.  \"wait no, I had this just the other day.\" I don\\'t have children of my own but if I did, I would want my child to feel that the house is their home as much as it is mine. Your home should be the place that you are most comfortable; where better to begin exploring the joys of sex than the comfort of your own bed? I wouldn\\'t ever want sex to be something my child feels guilty about and so I would never object object to them having sex in their own house. Yeah, I agree, I\\'m just thinking if sex *was* the trigger I\\'m not sure it would happen that fast. If she had a UTI beforehand and had those symptoms coincidentally after she had sex, that would be one thing, but if she\\'s peeing visible blood the day after sex on a regular basis, and that *doesn\\'t* happen otherwise, I think something more is going on. Either way, OP needs to see a doctor ASAP. I agree that it is! I\\'ve had a ridiculous number of UTIs though and from what my doctor told me visible blood is a sign that the infection is worsening, not that it\\'s just started. Got into her \"pajamas\" at a party, which are just yoga pants. She has a great ass. I know all my friends were checking her out. Yes, a lot of people *are* assholes. That\\'s great, but his sister\\'s luxury children are no one\\'s problem except hers. In an hour or so there\\'ll be a \"What does your SO do to annoy you?\" thread, so just be patient and enjoy the blessings of single life. Also Blood and Gold, Marius\\' story.  Catch Her in the Eye It\\'s sentimental tacky crap. There\\'s this woman I know from high school whom I would be in a relationship with if we didn\\'t live 3,000 miles apart. She\\'s told me about how she\\'s so embarrassed about her legs because of how she used to cut them. ~~If~~ When I see her exposed legs for the first time, I want to lovingly stroke her scars and tell her that they\\'re part of what makes her beautiful. And they are, because they tell a story, and despite the tragedy along the way, the storyline has lead us to this perfect moment, and I wouldn\\'t want it to be with anyone else. I\\'m a guy and these are my numbers with women:\\n\\nHad sex with: 30+\\n\\nButt-fingered: 15+\\n\\nShe enjoyed anal play enough to make fingers part of the routine: ~10\\n\\nI went for dick anal with: 4\\n\\nAnal during one night stand: 2\\n\\nAnal was a very regular thing with: 2\\n\\nSometimes you can just tell if a person is too uptight for anal, so often I wouldn\\'t even try. If all 30+ of my partners had been long-term, I\\'m betting around half would have eventually made anal a regular thing. Of the two that did make anal a regular thing, one was a completely normal long-term girlfriend and the other was a super-kinky fuck buddy. Everybody has their interests!\\n\\n [Whoosh](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcReSVTgYtsyG0W5F5Im4br-MedGQhH9jiR_kbW7oQgC_UbfAF9GNw) Unf. Women who dance and sing like that are just so adorable. An endearing trait for sure. AND ALL THE ROADS WE HAVE TO WALK ARE WINDING &gt; Don\\'t say \"doing your wife.\" Don\\'t say \"doing your wife.\" Don\\'t say \"doing your wife.\"\\n\\nDoing your... son? Okay, dammit, this is the third time in 2 days I’ve seen the phrase *”in that voice…”*  Somebody explain this damned voice to me! Right? I never thought about it before past the lines of \\'it\\'s fun\\' but it really is seeing the changes in my partner that makes it so hot.  I don’t recommend eating baked *shit*.  That goes for the rest of you, too! I would think so, but not entirely sure. It probably depends on what position you\\'re in (might be easier if you\\'re coming from behind) and how both of you are shaped. Whiskey dick roulette? I personally didn\\'t like it, and I\\'ve heard that sometimes  during intercourse the ring can get caught in the tip of the penis but i never had that problem. \\n\\nIt didn\\'t do much for regulating my period, and it was mostly just uncomfortable. It fell out a couple times when i was just moving around, like shopping or cleaning the house, probably constant bending and standing made it wiggle out or something. Part of using the ring means being comfortable pulling it out/putting it in more than you\\'d initially think.\\n\\nI know some people who swear by it though, so when finding a bc method that works for you, it takes trial and error.  HPV specifically. I\\'ll be back with some. In the mean time, feel free to dig a little on your own. [Yes, so graceful, so beautiful.](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/1951120/getting-out-of-bed-o.gif) Doesn\\'t it rather defeat the purpose of deleting a comment if someone is going to just repost it? &gt; *\"Bend over you slut!\"* I know what that gif is, and it\\'s deleted.  So everyone else would be clothed, but you wouldn\\'t? I don\\'t follow. Are you a girl? Correction, Ecstasy or the X is actually NOT pure form. MDMA is the active ingredient in Ecstasy and is considered pure.  I\\'m assuming /u/torinaga once had a similar attitude. But the rules, as reported, suggest that when the tower gets knocked down, everyone gets to put their clothes back on, except for the person who knocked it down.  So it\\'s a little like an \"authoritative dad\" or \"commander of a fleet\" voice? Boyfriend and I used one once (inherited it from a friend who found out she is allergic to latex and gave us her condom stash). He said it felt weird, though not necessarily bad. Putting it in was not sexy, and it felt like I had a Ziploc bag up there.  Boyfriend and I did it 8 times one day (and that was while dodging roommates!) That\\'s definitely not typical though, unfortunately we\\'re out of our hump like bunnies phase (both busy with work and school) so it\\'s more like once a day now.  People have already responded to the first question (if she\\'s been taking it carefully, it\\'s definitely started working by now), but I wanted to add to the answer for the second question:\\n\\nAfter I have sex, I just go pee. The semen comes out then. I\\'ve never needed to \"push\" it out, and I suspect they do it that way in porn because it\\'s graphically arousing for the audience?\\n\\nFor me, sitting on the toilet + gravity + peeing has always been enough. But if she feels the need to push it out, she can, it\\'s not gonna hurt her... nor is keeping it inside if she falls asleep right afterwards for instance. It will eventually come out.\\n\\nThe depth doesn\\'t matter, and neither does the day you do it. If the birth control you\\'re talking about is the pill, she does not have real cycles anymore, so she\\'s not more fertile on one day than another. Use the *rule of thirds* to place your mustaches for bonus drinking!\\n\\n[More info here](http://digital-photography-school.com/rule-of-thirds)  Oh, good, another item to add to my \"things I\\'ll never experience\" list. I said in my original post that condoms are incompatible with oil based lube, so no one is mentioning that because it was already mentioned.  After every orgasm, take a shot. Which one does this fall under? Rape? Post an update, oddly curious to hear how it turns out. I\\'ve seen two men cry in front of me, and both times it tore me up. One being my father (once), the other a former SO (a few times, and once he was yelling at me; it was a bad situation, not abusive).\\n\\nI never lost respect for them over that. If anything, I felt they were at their most vulnerable, that they were being their most honest with me. And that\\'s very key--honesty. A degree of openness after a certain time.\\n\\nHonestly, I hate seeing it, but I\\'d be lying if I said it didn\\'t make me feel closer to them (at the time), either. I\\'ve been told I give damn good head--but my last SO almost never came from it. I can count the number of times on one hand, even if I was missing a finger or two. So, a couple. But his case was particularly interesting; it wasn\\'t that he didn\\'t enjoy it, or that he masturbated too much (though, he did frequently enough). To him it was a mental issue, and he actually had to be *distracted* in order for it to work. The first time I recall most vividly; he was only able to achieve orgasm from me sucking his dick because he was also eating me out. It distracted him enough that he was able to let go. Apparently I was the first woman (as far as I know, only, but meh) to do it, though I\\'m pretty sure it was a combination of luck and skill.\\n\\nAs for how I typically do it... pretty basic. No need for a lot of tricks. Use a firm grip (not tight; firm) with one hand, and suck with your mouth. Just go with what feels natural in the moment (or what he asks for, if he does); whatever makes you happiest and most enthusiastic is going to translate pretty well. I couldn\\'t say what my exact movements are. I just love sucking cock, so I go to town and enjoy the hell out of it. If I want his head to hit the back of my throat, I\\'ll make it happen. If I want to tease the tip, I will. So long as he doesn\\'t object, I just do what I want to.\\n\\nSo, in short... ask him. Maybe he masturbates too much, maybe it\\'s a mental thing, maybe he just never really has been able to. Maybe you\\'re thinking too hard about it and not just enjoying the moment. Hard to say.\\n\\nBut most importantly, enjoy *doing* it. Giving head isn\\'t just for him; it should be exciting for you as well. If it\\'s not constantly bleeding, then you probably damaged a blood vessel in/around the anal sphincter, that is pinched closed when your anus is closed, and pulled open you pass stool. It will heal, but is probably going to be prone to rupturing again the next time you do anal. Talk to a doctor at your earliest convenience for some proper medical advice for the long-term. &gt;She told me not to worry about it\\n\\n&gt;A few days later she added me on Facebook\\n\\n&gt;Was I monster?\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t see you as one, otherwise she wouldn\\'t have added you on Facebook so she can keep talking to you.. &gt; my best (male) friend, who is the most romantic person I know\\n\\n&gt;seems to be into domination and buggering his wife\\n\\nAlways the quiet ones... or the ones you would\\'nt expect.. :D I feel as though the stem of it isn\\'t necessarily being \"raped\" per se; she wants to be submissive, and be dominated very roughly by several men at once.\\n\\nBeing submissive/being dominated is a common female fantasy, as is being gang-banged. She has combined them. My ex used to cry just \\'because he loved me so much\\'. Cute the first time, quickly creepy after a while. If there\\'s something to actually shed a tear over, go ahead. Bridge to Terabithia for example, but just love? What? Hugs are always quite welcome! Not at all! I treasure those moments when my husband truly opens up to me and allows himself to be vulnerable. It makes me sad that men feel uncomfortable showing their emotions because they\\'re taught it\\'s not \"manly.\" Especially when my husband gets teary-eyed while he\\'s telling me how much I mean to him, I just get all melty inside. I\\'m not a doctor but I\\'ve made a lot of bums bleed in my day. Here\\'s how to prevent it:\\n\\n1) If a dick is huge, don\\'t stick it in another person\\'s butthole\\n\\n2) Lube the dick\\n\\n3) Lube the butthole\\n\\n4) Shave the dick\\n\\n5) Shave the butthole\\n\\n6) Get the butthole person drunk\\n\\n7) Go slow prior to going fast\\n\\n8) Use your finger first\\n\\n9) Talk dirty in the ear\\n\\n10) practice make perfect\\n\\n You\\'re right, most women aren\\'t like that. Only jerks make fun of somebody who confides in them. I agree with Kallisti_gold. If I\\'m not in the mood, sexual touch will turn me off more, then gradually disgust or scare me, and eventually make me not want to pursue sex with that person later even if I am horny.\\n\\nNon-sexual touch, however, can arouse me if I\\'m not in the mood to begin with. I mean things like hugs and so on, that are not sexual, and (that part is important) not given with the intent of making me horny. It makes me feel loved and appreciated for who I am and not just as a vessel to jerk off into, and that makes me trust the person, which is a requirement for me to get horny.\\n\\nSo I have no clue if your girlfriend works like me, but you might want to be affectionate a lot, without trying to pressure her for sex. The more non-sexual contact you have, the more she can trust that you won\\'t want to pressure her into sex every single time you show some affection, which should take some of the pressure off.\\n\\nSince she\\'s had past experiences of painful sex, it must be difficult for her to make herself vulnerable to you, even though she knows that rationally, you don\\'t want to hurt her, and it won\\'t her (her condition is better, right?), there is still the past memories there, so it\\'s probably going to take a while. I would say, try to tell yourself there won\\'t be sex for a while, and welcome it if it happens but do your best not to expect it, and to get your satisfaction from other sources until she feels better (by that I don\\'t mean cheating on her, of course). no i don\\'t see why i would, it means they really trust you and are comfortable to show their emotions.  As a guy whose gf smokes...can confirm, operating as intended.  Your laziness is just completely astounding.\\n\\nhttp://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00313029309084794\\n\\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC84313/\\n\\nhttp://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/getting-tested-for-herpes/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0\\n\\nNow fuck off, douche. Just be careful, there was an article on here recently that talked about that kind of masturbation being potentially harmful. Oh, yes. Wet hands are a must. I keep my touch light until there\\'s enough saliva to work with. People actually couldn\\'t hear the V2s, and that was one of the reasons that made them so scary.  They could hear the V1s coming, but the V2s were faster than the speed of sound so one second there was nothing and the next explosion.  A V1, perhaps. It\\'s at least a solid 3.5\" erect. I was working at a mall with a company that is no longer in business. I was the assistant manager at the time and this girl that liked me came in and we were basically over at the time. She asked me what it would take to get back together and I told her that my only weakness was seeing her naked and since we were in the middle of a mall that wouldn\\'t be happening.\\n\\nWell she decided that she would go into the dressing room and get naked. She opened the door and told me to come here she had something to show me. Well I didn\\'t believe that she would get naked so I went over and there she was in all her glory. \\n\\nThere was no one in the store at the time and this urge just overcame me and I went over to her and dropped my pants. She was already wet and that got me hard so I just dove straight in and went to town. It was over in about 10 minutes I held my hand over her mouth to keep her quiet but there was still that smacking sound of me taking her from behind.\\n\\nWhen it was over I pulled up my pants and went back to work and nope didn\\'t get back with her. That was our breakup sex basically. Still friends with her after all these years too.\\n\\ndl;dr Had sex in dressing room of store I was managing while it was open for business. ...Unless she really wants to know about your preference in boobs, you don\\'t actually need to share it. It wouldn\\'t make your opinion seem more valid, it would just make it seem like you spend way too much time thinking about and judging women\\'s bodies, including hers. Even if it\\'s a positive judgement- it\\'s not really your business.\\n\\nIt might make you feel better, but it\\'d probably just make her uncomfortable. Which isn\\'t really what you\\'re going for.\\n\\n Been married 15 years still get them almost every time we have sex. Also there are times when she is turned on she will drop to her knees and pop me in her mouth getting me turned on for later whether we have sex or not.

I have this.  I never knew it was a thing other people had too. I was with a great guy for three years - we broke up because the sex was awful. He was the one person I was supposed to be sexually intimate with, the one person who should have made me feel desired and beautiful. But sex with him just made me feel so terrible about myself - used and violated and ugly and disconnected and just... ugh. I know, it sounds so extreme, you think it could never happen to you, right? He was honestly so great and loving in every other aspect of our relationship. We were doomed by sexual inexperience and being incompatible.\\n\\nI think you\\'ve underestimated how powerful sex in a relationship can be emotionally. I never feel closer to my (now) boyfriend than when we\\'re having sex. If I\\'m upset or angry... sex always makes me feel better. It makes me feel loved, connected, wanted, desired, beautiful, confident, sexy... it\\'s just not about the physical pleasure for me. It improves my entire day. It strengthens us as a couple.\\n\\nHaving now experienced a fulfilling sexual relationship, I would never go back. Great sex is an absolute necessity in my romantic relationships.\\n\\nHere\\'s what I didn\\'t know at 16: that I was capable of falling in love for a second time. With my first love, I thought - surely I could never feel this way about anyone else? My current boyfriend is my third love, and he\\'s perfect and amazing and I\\'d be lucky to share my life with him... but I also know that, if it doesn\\'t work out, I\\'ll find love again. I don\\'t have to settle for a relationship that has a huge flaw like sexual incompatibility because there\\'s no such thing as The One. We get a choice in the matter, which is awesome!\\n\\nI will say that my brother and my sister both married their first partners. My two best friends both got married at twenty years old. All four of those couples started dating as teenagers. I believe that young love can work. I would just advise you to invest in your relationship sexually, to realise that it can be a powerful emotional bond, that it can make your love even stronger. Same here. My ears, the sides of my neck, and that muscle that attaches my neck to my shoulders. Instant turn-on.\\n\\nI\\'ve been with a couple guys who like having their ears played with. But one I\\'ll never forget--he would violently shudder and lose all pretense of trying to be quiet if I so much as licked his earlobe. Massively hot reaction. Dude, you missed the whole point.  \"Nice guys\" who think that a female friend owes them sex/relationship just because they\\'re nice isn\\'t a nice guy at all, he\\'s a jerk pretending to a be a nice guy.\\n\\nWomen and men can be platonic friends.  If a guy develops feelings for her, he can go ahead and tell her, but if she doesn\\'t return those feelings, it doesn\\'t mean she\\'s emotionally using him, it means she just isn\\'t sexually/romantically attracted to him!  If he can\\'t handle that, by all means, he should end the friendship (and that wouldn\\'t make him a jerk).   I had a lot of male friends like this in high school.  It was pretty obnoxious.  I had one friend I really cherished, we had a similar sense of humor, spent hours talking on the phone, etc.  But I wasn\\'t physically attracted to him.  He eventually told me, on the phone, that he thought of us as being \"in a relationship\".  I was like \"Uh, can I respond to that?\" and he said \"No, just think about it, I\\'ve got to go, but let\\'s talk tomorrow.\"\\n\\nI being 16 and maybe not that emotionally mature ended up avoiding him for a few weeks because I was torn. I adored him as a friend and didn\\'t want to break his heart, but I was angry that he decided we were in a relationship without my consent, and nervous about being around him knowing how he felt for me.  Our friendship never recovered.  I don\\'t know if it could have if I\\'d just talked with him frankly and told him I didn\\'t feel the same way.\\n\\nThe other guys who were interested in me after we were friends I didn\\'t value that much as friends, and found that once I told them I wasn\\'t interested in them romantically they ended up not talking to me.  So they were only my friends as long as they thought they had a shot.\\n\\nThis bullshit is one of the reasons I just started avoiding making straight guy friends when I was single.  Now that I\\'m married, I have a few straight guy friends, who I know are my friends because they like me and not because they\\'re trying to get in my pants. You\\'re still operating under the assumption that any guy can make any girl want to fuck him/be in a relationship with him if he acts the right way.  But this isn\\'t how women work.  (It\\'s not how men work, either).\\n\\nIf a guy thinks that a romantic/sexual relationship will happen naturally because a woman likes him as a friend, he\\'s sorely mistaken.   Not all women are attracted to any man they like as a friend and there\\'s nothing guys can do about it except figure out whether they really value her as a FRIEND or if they\\'re looking for a girlfriend in the exact wrong way, in which case he should stop developing close friendships with women, and actively pursue them romantically from the start. Didn\\'t break it, but the bottom pieces to hold the box frame up hadn\\'t been screwed in yet (brand new bed; literally breaking it in). So there was a *crack!* and the mattress tipping sideways. He didn\\'t stop fucking me. My bed somehow survived. I somehow came. LOL, now-husband and I broke a bracket on my old bed frame, and it was properly put together. The metal bracket looked TORN. I had forgotten about that until your comment! Probably because I had to tell my parents about it to get it fixed....  Tinder  &gt; i would have wondered all afternoon about the ...\\n\\n*(puts on shades)*\\n\\n&gt; [outcum](http://mirrors.rit.edu/instantCSI/). 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, 84, 98, 112, 126, 140, 154, 168, 182, 196, 210, 224, 238, 252, 266, 280... You mention loving with your mind and your heart, that you see physical acts as a way to express that love.\\n\\nThat is a huge part of the issue for many couples - we all express love differently, and we all feel our partner\\'s love for different reasons. I don\\'t know if you\\'ve heard of the Five Love Languages, but they are worth a look. Mine are words of affirmation (compliments, thank yous, I love yous) and physical affection (kissing, cuddling, hand holding, massages, sex). On days when we can\\'t have sex for whatever reason, he makes sure he is physically affectionate with me in other ways, or that he lets me know how much he appreciates me through words. He makes sure that I feel loved by him every day.\\n\\nSex becomes such an issue in relationships because it leaves one or both partners feeling unloved, undesired or unappreciated. For instance, quality time might be one of your love languages - just a guess from the fact that you love talking to your girlfriend all day. If that is the case, imagine if your girlfriend said, \"Hey, I\\'m sick of talking to you all the time. I\\'d rather be out with my friends. How about we talk for two hours every second Sunday?\" Can you see that you might be hurt by this? \\n\\nIt\\'s the same way for many people with sex. If my boyfriend told me that he\\'d be fine if our relationship became celibate, because he loves me anyway, I\\'d be devastated. Because I want sex to be important to him like it\\'s important to me - I need it to matter. \\n\\nYou are right, of course, that people are different, and as long as you and your girlfriend are on the same page, then you\\'re all set. If your boyfriend hasn\\'t ever dressed up for you or done any kind of role playing to seduce you then he\\'d better not be expecting you to do it for him. That shit goes both ways. Only a loser would expect that. Most of my partners and I seduce each other pretty much equally...same moves, same games, same general behavior.\\n\\nMy girls do this stuff:\\n\\n* Send me a text at work saying how much they wish I was there, sometimes to do ____ to them, even though they know I can\\'t come see them!\\n\\n* Send me texts saying how much they liked it when I did ____ to them last night and how they can\\'t wait for me to do it again (general sexting)\\n\\n* Send me texts telling me they are wearing my favorite _____, and then they just won\\'t respond.\\n\\n* Sit on my lap and encourage my full attention.\\n\\n* While we are out in public they\\'ll pull my hands down near their crotch or ass and bite their lip and smile (or more extreme).\\n\\n* They generally tease me, which I fucking love.\\n\\n* They\\'ll wear certain items that I like or do other things that they know I like, and they\\'ll make sure that I know that they know.\\n\\n* They\\'ll flirt with me like we aren\\'t dating (especially in front of people).\\n\\n* They\\'ll initiate sex, whether it be in public, in the car, on the couch, or in bed.\\n\\nBasically, it\\'s the little subtle stuff that does it. A healthy, spicy, fun relationship requires action from both parties. Whatever he does to you, try it on him. If he wants you to do something that doesn\\'t especially arouse you, try it anyway and expect him to return the favor. If you are interested in more information regarding actual psychological seduction, there\\'s a sub for that, and yes, there are many female subscribers: /r/seduction  *audience laughing and applauding over freeze frame with credits* Were you fucking in a lab or something? Because that would make it so much hotter. If that isn\\'t enough then he\\'d better be returning the favor. FYI, there are girls out there (I am one of them) who has told guys flat out that they\\'re too big, and refused to see them again. some \"big\" guys are so big that I bleed and ache for days, even if all appropriate steps were taken to prevent that. Annoyingly, guys do not find this to be a good reason to stop seeing them, and get quite upset about it. \\n\\nI literally have to size guys up by looking at them, to gauge if their penis is small enough. I refuse to date guys over 6\\' because I just can\\'t deal with the inevitable unpleasant sex.\\n\\nI\\'m into this guy right now and I\\'m hoping/praying that he\\'s small because I like him so much, he\\'s 5\\'11 too so your post gives me hope. do it and see what happens ahahha. well talk alot women eat that british accent up. Also say your going to leave soon back to europe and they will be more interested in you. If they thank your leaving they will be more likely to jump your bone for a one night stand. I can\\'t really offer any advice. All I want to say is that woman is a loser and I apologize on behalf of the female gender. That\\'s because most people don\\'t understand shades of grey. It\\'s either leave, or bang him. And leaving like she did was wrong, so she had to bang him. Makes sense if you don\\'t live in the real world Practicing good posture will also do this. Buy a lock box.  When he gets home, everybody has to put their phone in the box through prime-time.  You are the only keyholder. Or you could just do 7x14 = 7x10 + 7x4 as a less roundabout way of doing it. Gotta love the distributive property. thats you being into something fully. nothing wrong with that. I get that feeling when i go on rollercosters and such. offer to paint a older relatives room for them for free and al they have to do is buy the paint and you will do the rest. then take the stuff you dont use. landing strip &gt; as anyone here truly stopped fucking someone because they had a small dick? Like in the moment, just said hey this isn\\'t really worth it to me? That is fucking selfish and strange.\\n\\nIt is not being a jerk to stop having sex when she did not feel comfortable/want to do it.  He is not entitled to sex with her, even if she previously agreed to it.  And it is entirely possible for her to know that 3.5 inches is not going to do it for her (although there are probably many women who would be fine with it.  \\n\\nTo put it into terms a guy might understand.  What if you brought a girl back and she was wearing shapewear and a push up bra and her body underneath was not attractive.  Does that guy owe her sex at this point?\\n\\n Clearly she\\'s under no obligation to have sex with him; that being said, you really don\\'t think there\\'s something wrong with the way she handled things?  Like if I got naked, put a condom on and took the girls top off, balked and said \"I\\'m sorry your boobs are too small/you have serious stretch marks/too much belly fat, I can\\'t have sex with you.\"  Or started sex, stopped and said \"Your vagina is way too loose, I can\\'t have sex with you\" and walked out.\\n\\nYou\\'re basically *shattering* the other person\\'s self-esteem in one fell swoop.  And yes, finding a polite, tactful way to get out of the situation wouldn\\'t fool anyone, *but it\\'s the nice thing to do.*  Just like how I would tell my SO that I don\\'t notice any cellulite on her legs; she obviously has eyes, she fucking knows it\\'s there, but it\\'s nice to hear that kind of shit.  That stranger I just told to \"Have a nice night\"?  We both know I could care less if he had the worst night of his miserable fucking life but it\\'s still nice to say, and it\\'s nice to hear.  I don\\'t know why, that\\'s just human social interaction for you. Ah yes, I\\'m so glad he can start working on *the size of his cock.*  With some real elbow-grease I\\'m sure he can be packing 8\" in no time. Everyone with your opinion is certainly entitled to it; that being said, I hope you all think long and hard about possible gender bias influencing your opinion.  Think about a woman posting: \"I dated this guy for weeks and he came back to my place for sex.  We started to have sex but after a few minutes he said \"Your pussy is too loose and it isn\\'t working for me.\" and left.  I\\'m absolutely heart-broken, help me understand why.\"\\n\\nWould you be making the same posts?  Only you can really answer that.\\n\\nAlso I don\\'t understand all these \"Should she have just fucked him anyways even if she didn\\'t want to?\" posts.  Read the original post, she *did* choose to fuck him.  She just ended it abruptly and left. There\\'s very little he can do.  And what he can do will still definitely keep him in the less than average range.  That\\'s why your argument kind of fell short for me.  There\\'s a reason you don\\'t walk up to your friend in the wheelchair and say \"Hey you\\'d probably get more action if your legs worked.  Just thought you should know so now you can work on fixing that as much as humanly possible.\"  \\n\\nSometimes its better to allow someone a little room for mental gymnastics to keep their confidence from crashing and burning, and I feel like this is the case with OP.  Just as someone who is wheelchair-bound surely knows it\\'s limiting them sexually, OP is surely aware he has a small penis and it limits him; that doesn\\'t mean it won\\'t hurt like hell when someone bluntly throws it in your face. Haha, I don\\'t know why you felt the need to throw in some bitchy innuendo when I was being civil, but that\\'s cool.  Not that you can ever actually say this on the internet without looking like a liar...but I was lucky enough to be well-endowed =X. guess I just have bad luck then. I\\'ve definitely spent enough time in 6\\' land to notice a trend.'"

       "'Whenever I look at these, I always think that in the best fits, people are way more out there with color combinations than I am.  I always get nervous about using warmer colors like reds and yellows, and almost exclusively stick to blues, purples, greys, and greens.  A lot of these fits make me think I should branch out more, but it also might be a personal style thing. I think there\\'s some great fits in there, but it\\'s also reinforcing my opinion that pea coats are kinda overdone right now. I live in an apartment, and I personally hang my shirts on the curtain rod in the shower overnight.  Works fine.  Dunno what to do if you\\'re in a dorm without a private bathroom, though. Drive to Freeport.  It\\'s like a pilgrimage. Hm, dug into this a little because it seemed weird, what with that logo being the same as camel cigarettes, and I thought it might be just a random \"asian countries like things that look vaguely American\" thing that you see when you travel in asia all the time.  But no, it looks like RJ Reynolds actually had their own brand of boots that they would advertise on TV using the exact same imagery as they did for their cigarettes...but they were advertising boots, not cigarettes, so it was fine to put the ads on tv, right?  There\\'s a bit about it [here](http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_176.pdf).  Anyway, they don\\'t appear to make them anymore, so you can take em to a cobbler and see if they can do anything, but otherwise I don\\'t think there\\'s much else you can do. I like myhabit the best of them due to the shipping speeds and the fact that it\\'s amazon means that they can actually give you good deals sometimes.  Gilt gets criticism because companies sometimes do runs of items specially for Gilt that are lower quality (like Naked &amp; Famous jeans that aren\\'t selvage), and their original prices are often pretty fictional.  It really helps if you have familiarity with what you\\'re buying.  They\\'re all pretty terrible at giving accurate measurements or useful info about a product. (like a $300 belt where the only info about it is \"leather.\"  you think someone might want a little more info about, say, what *kind* of leather before they drop $300 on a belt?)  Avoid stuff that you can\\'t return unless you\\'re really, really sure it\\'ll fit right.\\n\\nI\\'ll also add that you should avoid the whole \"oh i must grab this now it\\'s only available today!\" instinct.  It wouldn\\'t hurt to just watch the sites while buying absolutely nothing for a month or two so that you can get an idea of what stuff they stock.  Most of the places cycle through the same brands pretty often, so if you miss an item, it\\'ll probably be back soon enough. Eh, that\\'s all debatable, but regardless of what labels you want to put on either one for sexual orientation or her for gender/sex/whatever, if he doesn\\'t like dick it probably isn\\'t gonna work out. And when we\\'re reading the reviews, let us filter by rating.  I always want to read the 1 star reviews to see if the app does push ads or sends home data about you or something like that. MyHabit tends to sell the same brands pretty often.  I\\'d just wait for it to come around again. Is that... Beefaroni?  My cats do that. It usually ends with the big spoon biting the back of the little spoon\\'s neck.  I have one. They\\'re nice, if a little thin.  He can always say that they don\\'t fit.  Same. I\\'ll make huge purchases on a whim because I saw something that seemed cool. Online shopping makes it really easy to not notice the pain of how much something costs, too. It\\'s bad in a way, but on the other hand, I can talk myself out of a big purchase pretty easily because I know I\\'ll probably want something else by the time my next paycheck rolls around.  I dunno, charcoal is a good basic color, but I\\'d almost go for something more fun, like a non-navy blue.  Nice, but... Isn\\'t steak kind of the opposite of something where sous vide would be a good way to cook it? The whole \"not cooked evenly all the way through\" thing is a desirable thing with steak.  It may be over rising and then collapsing. Where are you leaving it to rise? You should ideally do it in the fridge to slow the rise. If you still have the same problem, use less of the starter. \\n\\nYou could probably just skip letting it rise overnight, at least at first. Just let it rise until it about doubles in size, which is usually about an hour and a half or so at room temperature.  Yeah, basically, if you let it rise too long it will just collapse. Sometimes you do a longer rise to get a more consistent texture (this is good for things like pizza dough), but when you do, you want to put it somewhere cool to slow down the rise. You don\\'t want to let it rise overnight at room temperature.  For a non CDB suggestion, I have a pair of Red Wing Beckman chukkas that I like.  Yeah, I have these, and they\\'re amazing.  Tissot z253 today. Decent watch. I have to admit that I\\'m kinda in love with Rados right now and I\\'m thinking of picking one up.  This should be at /r/mildlyinfuriating  You\\'re close to summing up why /r/shittyfoodporn exists, but you forgot to include a bong in the picture.  Coming to terms with the fact that all of your partners have a history is a big part of growing up, I\\'d say.  There\\'s this one diner I eat at that has a men\\'s room with three urinals, like, *right* next to each other with no divider, and then a toilet at the end just out in the open with no stall around it.  And then it has a lock on the door.  I just lock it when I go in there even if I\\'m just taking a leak. Not great.  Made in Mexico these days.  I bought a pair that was on sale for $150 (normally $250ish) and I gotta say that while I don\\'t feel ripped off at that price, I don\\'t think they\\'re worth anywhere near their normal price. Consensus in the past has been that they\\'re lower quality than the price would indicate.   They don\\'t look like they\\'re in terrible shape and I don\\'t see anything offensive about the design.  I would get better laces, though.  They\\'d look better with round, waxed laces. If you\\'ve got a Nordstrom Rack near you, they have a pretty large selection of larger sizes.  I don\\'t really agree. Not everyone cares that much about the movement of their watch, and even cheap quartz is reasonably accurate these days. Not to mention automatics are kind of a pain in the ass if you don\\'t wear them every day.  I was wondering if it was my keyboard doing it, but I noticed that Facebook Messenger lets me see what I\\'m replying to, so it seems like something a SMS client could allow. If I changed keyboards, would I be forced to disable full-screen always in landscape?  Ah Christ, I really didn\\'t need to spend another $200 this morning...  Their wool socks are solid.  I want to say Florsheim has a similar pair, as well.  Depends on the office, but they\\'re definitely not going to pass as business casual. On the other hand I wear Katahdins in the office all the time.  I just got a pair of Bonobos cords that are just comfy as hell. Other than that probably one of the flannels I own. \\n\\nAlso my Frye boots are just damn comfortable.  As cliché as it is, jeans and an OCBD are just a classic \"put it on and look ok without having to think about it\" outfit. I also wear a lot of henleys when I\\'m not planning to leave the house.  Dress pants. Good ones just cost so damn much. \\n\\nAlso suits but I wear one maybe twice a year.  One of the nice things about the Katahdins (especially if you find them on sale) is that they\\'re cheap enough that you don\\'t mind beating the shit out of them. But YMMV. I think enough people wear fake fur that people don\\'t really think about it. Plus big fur coats just seem to have gone out of style mostly. \\n\\nPersonally I\\'ve always thought it was a bit silly to wear leather and eat meat but then get really upset because someone else wears fur.\\n I figured it out eventually. I think the secret was that the game lied to you when it told you which direction to go. If you ignored it and did what looked right, it worked. It took forever before I figured that out, though.  God, why did that game make it so awful to get all the ultimate weapons? Pretty much every character had one task that completely sucked.  Because it\\'s pretty anachronistic, which tends to fit the hipster \"ironic\" motif. If you care if people think you\\'re a hipster for wearing it, then don\\'t buy it.  Er, plastic bag from safeway?  Honestly if you bought brand new ones and wore them for a week they\\'d probably show just as much wear. I\\'d keep em.  I\\'m glad I\\'m already broke, because I want to make some very poor budgetary decisions with the black fleece stuff. Also much more expensive, but on clearance some of the stuff could be worth it. Was eyeing some of the sweaters.  I dunno, I sub to FFA and find it interesting, *because* it\\'s so different.\\n\\nI also think that men\\'s designer fashion tends to follow closer to female fashion rules (or lack thereof). Ebay, thrift stores, etc.  Or buy a retro casio because I don\\'t think theirs have changed at all since the 80s. I\\'m going to say you\\'re probably far enough in that it\\'s going to look bad.  But, if there\\'s a cobbler near you, they can resize a belt for you pretty cheaply.  ($10 at my local cobbler) I always wonder what percentage of /r/conspiracy people are trolling.  Shit, wait, is that a conspiracy? One benefit of working through a recruiter (which is pretty common if you\\'re in a tech field) is that you can often get them to negotiate for you. And you can have more frank conversations with them about what the likely salary range is. Don\\'t know why flannel would be bad for a date specifically.  It\\'s obviously a casual fit.  Dude looks good without resorting to increasing the level of formality like a lot of people have an instinct to do. If you don\\'t have skills that differentiate you from the pack?  Sure.  As you build a resume, however, you become more and more of a unique quantity and get a lot more leverage in the negotiations.  Just graduated college with a CS degree?  Pretty run of the mill.  5 years experience as a developer?  Much better.  5 years experience as a developer in a specific industry that\\'s highly specialized?  That could potentially make you very valuable.\\n\\nAlso the reality is that most people hiring basically have a range that they can work in depending on the job title and your experience.  If you ask for something within that range, then they\\'ll usually just give it to you.  If you\\'re slightly above that range, then they\\'ll probably counter with the top of the range.  If you\\'re way above, then they\\'ll probably just let you walk since they figure they can\\'t afford you.  In really rare circumstances, if you\\'re a perfect fit, they may try to fight to get you something more, like a little bit above the range they were thinking, or perhaps inclusion in the bonus pool.  It\\'s also worth noting that they\\'re generally going to know your pay at your last job (it\\'s usually part of the application process), so if you\\'re overplaying your hand it probably won\\'t work. I agree that the advice is overly broad, but I think the point he\\'s trying to make is that people are sometimes afraid that tucking is formal and therefore you shouldn\\'t do it in a casual outfit, when really it can create a nice dividing line in a casual fit as well.  \"It\\'s casual so always untuck\" would be just as bad of a rule as \"Nothing is ever wrong with tucking.\"\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m gonna add that to me I would base it off of whether he\\'s planning on wearing that coat all night or not and where exactly the hem line of that flannel hits on him, cause I can\\'t quite tell from the photo. Well, with a solid piece of meat like a steak, you\\'re really worried about the surface bacteria, which is why you do a sear on the outside but can leave the middle essentially uncooked (if you like it that way, which I do).  With ground meat you need to make sure to cook the entire thing to a safe temperature since you\\'re mixing all kinds of different pieces of meat together.  That\\'s why I would argue that a sous vide really isn\\'t appropriate for steak. I saw this and thought it was /r/android.  I was so confused... I was driving by a surveyor the other day setting up his equipment when I realized that I have no idea what a surveyor actually does or for what purpose. I\\'ll add that a lot of restaurants will make the waiter pay for a tab that doesn\\'t get paid.  So you\\'re not only depriving them of part of their wage, you\\'re making them pay on top - in essence, it\\'s double stealing.  Most people are aware of this.  It\\'s just such a giant asshole thing to do. Unless you\\'re Jon Hamm, apparently. They\\'re the same ones Allen Edmonds uses (minus the branding). It\\'s not, but a lot of small business owners are either unaware of that fact or don\\'t care, and it\\'s hard for servers to dispute it, especially if they need the job.  And of course it became illegal because it was a common practice. I wonder if they\\'re a franchise. Usually corporate chains are more careful about that sorta thing. They don\\'t want to get caught in a class action suit.  Sorry, this is the correct answer.  On the plus side, the whole \"Oh my god the huge toebox looks so bad\" thing is a bit overblown around here. I was killing some time in a mall over the weekend, waiting for a place to finish adjusting my watch, when I walked past a Clarks store that said it was having a sale. I walked in, fondled a pair of beeswax CDBs, and left.  Also, the more I look at /r/watches, the more I realize I just don\\'t get watch people. I don\\'t understand the fascination with movements, and I really don\\'t understand the whole \"this place invented this feature 50 years ago and therefore their watches are worth more, because of history.\" I don\\'t begrudge anyone who does, but when it leaks into here when some dude is just looking for a watch that looks nice, it kinda bothers me.  I change by season but I like to have a signature scent. There\\'s so many perfumes where every time I smell them, I think of the girl I knew who wore it. So I like doing that for other people.  One of my friends asked me the other day, \"Is everything you\\'re wearing right now from Brooks Brothers?\"  Yeah, I get that, and I don\\'t disagree. But there\\'s also a line between education and \"Pffft, that\\'s a cheap quartz fashion watch, it\\'s complete crap, what are you thinking?\" when someone is just asking if it looks good. For a lot of people, a watch is more of a piece of jewelry than a timepiece. And I\\'m really not trying to trash on /r/watches, which seems like a friendly place. Just saying that I don\\'t really get the mindset.  I think it\\'s mostly just that we drink the whole time we\\'re on vacation.  See, I think that\\'s exactly the feeling I *don\\'t* have that makes me think I\\'ll never get it. It\\'s like when I\\'m listening to people talk about cars and I\\'m just thinking, \"Uh, so does it get good mileage?\" I guess I should just be happy since it will probably save me some money. \\n\\nI get it in concept, though. I get super excited about making a sourdough starter just because it must\\'ve seemed like pure magic to ancient cultures who had no idea what a microorganism was.  Let\\'s just say that how it was offered and how it was received may have been different.  Because I\\'m sure there\\'s no difference in build quality, aesthetics, or anything else whatsoever between any $150 quartz and a $30 Timex weekender.  That\\'s...pretty much exactly the attitude I\\'m talking about. Depending on climate, a pair of Chucks could be a good choice. And maybe pick up a good pair of starter boots, like Chippewa GQs or Apaches. I think that would give you a good rotation of styles, until you need to branch out into dressier footwear.  I think I\\'m lucky that these don\\'t come in my size.  Funny, I always thought it was striking how few butts ended up on the ground when I visited a few years ago, considering how many people smoked. Even with the fact that public trashcans were virtually nonexistent.  You might try [this one](http://www.myhabit.com/#page=d&amp;dept=men&amp;sale=A4ETA8J9IZYTK&amp;asin=B00D3YJPME&amp;cAsin=B00D3YJQ00&amp;qid=1390485538&amp;sindex=2&amp;ref=qd_men_sr_1_2).   I go out to dinner with my friends, although often not on my actual birthday. Although I didn\\'t really do anything this year. It\\'s not something that a huge deal to me, but if someone wants to by me a beer, not gonna turn it down.  I\\'m 33 and I\\'d say that yeah, some MFA advice won\\'t look great on  you. Skip the skinny jeans. On the other hand, it\\'s nice being older, because if you just decide to wear a sport coat out as part of a casual outfit, people won\\'t question it, unlike an 18 year old who might look out of place. Same with nice shoes. It also helps that if you\\'re older, it\\'s  probably a little easier to afford this stuff. \\n\\nI think as long as you have an idea of your personal style, MFA is fine. It also helps that a lot of MFA stuff tends to skew conservative.  Yeah, I think it\\'s pretty clear by D&amp;D rules that Durkon is now evil, and if he appears the same as he did before, it\\'s an intentional deception. Belkar has probably kept company with enough evil types before that he knows to not trust them even if they appear friendly.  Not quite olive, but I just ordered a pair of \"dark green\" Bonobos chinos yesterday. Looking forward to them, since I don\\'t do green very often.  Is there any consensus on what level Tarquin and his party are? I assumed they were epic level at first, but after seeing them fight I\\'m guessing just a few levels above the Order.  I might be in the minority here, but I generally hate popped jacket/coat collars, especially on pea coats where they\\'re gigantic.  It\\'s hard to tell, but they do look really long in that mirror shot. Probably the skinny jeans are adding to that effect, but I\\'m wondering if these actually fit you? I have huge size 14 feet but even with me my shoes don\\'t look that long. \\n\\nOr they might just be ugly shoes. Kenneth Cole does some really ugly stuff often.  He has that \"I\\'m embarrassed to be wearing this\" look that you see a lot on the flash sale sites\\' models.  The closing ceremony ones look much better... Except for the giant Polo logo.  In that case, I think you just bought ugly boots, unfortunately. But it doesn\\'t sound like you paid too much for them. I\\'d drop em off at goodwill and find some new boots, and then avoid Kenneth Cole in the future. Or keep them around as beaters.  I bought [this](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/MINI-OCTAGON-BUTTON-DOWN-SHIRT/FE00138_____NAVY_BB3______,default,pd.html) shirt on a whim and I\\'m not sure what to wear it with.  Any suggestions? As tempting as clothes are, I think I\\'d rather just get some flannel sheets. My main complaint about leather soles is that I feel like I can\\'t wear them at all during the winter.  Even on days where it\\'s warm and dry, there\\'s still huge piles of salt everywhere, which I\\'m afraid is just going to destroy the soles.  I even own a pair of rubber overshoes, but they\\'re kind of a pain to put on in the middle of the day, so I tend to just wear boots. For shirts with plastic buttons, I probably wouldn\\'t bother.  For shirts that have mother of pearl buttons, I button them up and turn them inside out to prevent the buttons from getting banged against the side of the washer and shattering.  Luckily I only have a couple of those, because it\\'s kind of a pain. Uh, why on earth would you think a different weave of cotton somehow has magic antibacterial properties?  Denim gets just as dirty as any other fabric, and you\\'ll note that part of the reason crotch blowouts are so common in raws is because that\\'s one of the areas that gets dirtiest.  You may or may not get higher contrast fades by not washing for longer, but don\\'t pretend your jeans are cleaning themselves somehow. I mean, the simple explanation is that the ones that get upvoted in the threads are the opinions which are popular.  The actual unpopular opinions get downvoted and you never see them. I\\'ve seen them at around $35 at Macy\\'s (in store). Nordstrom seems to discount them from time to time, too.  It\\'s way more efficient to drink your beer in the shower.  Same here. They\\'re a pretty big leap in quality over my Katahdins, too. Although half the reason I like the Katahdins is because I don\\'t mind them getting beat up, particularly in winter storms.  That\\'s kind of a bad example when you realize that\\'d be 2/3 of a cup of water, and pretty much anyone is going to have a liquid measuring cup with 2/3 marked on it.  You kind of get used to doing the conversions when you work in it all the time. Litigation.  Find someone to sue for the fact that you turned out lazy, fat, and poor.  I recommend McDonalds. [Appears to be this.](http://www.hiyaahpower.com/ministries_view.asp?subministryid=2059) I tend to find lots of pairs of Allen Edmonds...all of which are put on the wrong shelf and aren\\'t actually my size. I wouldn\\'t make a special trip for them, but if there\\'s one nearby it\\'s worth stopping in.  For example, my local one is doing clearance on chinos right now, and there\\'s lots of Bonobos and Rag and Bone chinos in the $40-50 range.  If you know your brands, there are definitely deals to be had.  But the very nature of the store is a crapshoot. Be aware that Naked and Famous has been known to do special runs for Gilt that are lower quality.  If they don\\'t say they\\'re selvedge, they\\'re not. I\\'ve noticed they\\'ve started providing a picture specifically of the selvedge, probably because of the number of complaints they got. I\\'d recommend the same thing I\\'d recommend for guys having trouble approaching women they\\'re attracted to: practice on people you\\'re not attracted to, only with the intention of talking.  If you get used to the idea of having conversations with people you don\\'t know, then the idea of talking to someone you\\'re attracted to won\\'t seem so out of place.  It also helps to get rid of the fear of messing things up.  The best way to get over the fear of rejection is to get rejected a few times. They don\\'t appear to be from either the description or pictures. I\\'d say that the reddit majority claims to be anti-capitalist, but in reality has a very poor understanding of what capitalism is. One thing I think that people always forget to mention is that dramatic pictures people post of fades after 6 months are often from people who wore them practically *every day* for 6 months.  For those of us who only wear jeans, say, a couple of times a week (or rotate more than one pair), your jeans are going to stay looking mostly like a very dark pair of jeans for a long time.  On the other hand, for some of us who dress for a more formal environment (a lot of offices these days are \"business casual but you can wear jeans as long as they\\'re nice jeans\"), that\\'s probably more desirable than having a super washed out pair of jeans with holes in the crotch. I dunno, I suspect that not subbing to FMF would save me a great deal of money in the long run. I think once you hit 30, the big thing is that exercising becomes not optional if you don\\'t want to feel like crap (and probably look like crap, too).  And you may not get sick any more often, but it takes a lot more out of you. I\\'ve been looking for a decent-looking cardigan that\\'s a reasonable bargain for, like, awhile now, and for some reason I\\'m just having no luck.  It\\'s not like they\\'re a rare item or anything.  I probably should\\'ve just gotten one from uniqlo awhile ago, but I\\'m always a little wary of going too cheap on knits. While that\\'s technically true (giving the government a free loan and all that), for most people the money they would make if they put it in a savings account or something would be pretty negligible.  It depends a lot on what you consider \"big\". Put a paper towel in the sink and then trim over the sink. Wipe up any strays.  I think that only applies to thick wallets. I have a \"Big Skinny\" wallet that\\'s super thin so I don\\'t think it\\'s an issue.  I\\'m about a 35.5 so I have the same problem. I give preference to brands that do exact measurements (Charles Tyrwhitt, Brooks Brothers), but other than that, you could buy a little long and get them tailored. I\\'d rather have the sleeves too long than too short, personally. \\n\\nUnfortunately even places that do exact measurements usually only so them for their dress shirts, so with sport shirts you\\'re out of luck. But on the plus side Brooks Brothers considers their OCBDs to be dress shirts and they\\'re some of the best around.  Nice boot but not a fan of the black version.  I think you\\'re missing more formal shoes, and a good summer shoe, so I\\'d probably go for wingtips and loafers next.  It just seems like outside of your captoes, your shoes lean more towards the casual end of the spectrum. So a good pair of wingtips (I\\'d probably leave towards cognac) would be good. And a pair of loafers to wear sockless is nice during the summer.  I have the Frye James ankle boots, and while they\\'re not terrible, full retail is way overpriced. The leather quality is a significant step down from Red Wings and other boots in that price range. On the other hand, they\\'re pretty comfortable, so at that price they\\'re not a bad pickup.  Also a lot of winter clearance sales right now, so cheap boots. \\n\\nPersonally I think my next purchase will probably be a nice pair of loafers for the summer, though.  I always find Strands too, I don\\'t know, show-off for wearing with a suit. I suppose pairing them with a skinny tie and a more fashion suit is OK, but they stand out too much to me with a more traditional suit. \\n\\n(I\\'m talking specifically about the walnut ones.)  For some reason, I think Chelsea boots are one of the few that hands down look better in black.  Simple, clean lines and a classic look. Dressy but understated. And yeah, women\\'s Chelsea boots are often nearly identical.  That\\'s what I do. I can usually fit one pair (with shoe trees) in my carry-on.  I\\'m a fan of Rag &amp; Bone jeans for washed.  Check the Nordstrom Rack if you have one near you. My local one has a whole bunch of chinos on sale right now for about 60% off retail.  I like 2(x)ist but it\\'s kind of personal preference.  Either that or the shirt. If the shirt is baggy and the sweater is slim, you kind of get rumples around the waist.  What are some good wool dress trousers with an aggressive taper and maybe a lower to medium rise? I always feel like they look shapeless on me. Less than $150 would be nice.  Yeah not necessarily my first choice, but I feel like they\\'re formal enough to look good with dressier outfits, but not totally out of place in a more casual outfit like, say, black captoes would be.  Chinos, chinos, chinos. Been trying to add more color to my wardrobe. Picked up some Bonobos chinos in dark olive, Khaki Supply (not really familiar with this brand but they were cheap) chinos in burgundy, and Obey chinos in mustard. It\\'s making me think outside my normal box in terms of matching them, but that\\'s exactly why I got them.  I suppose that\\'s true, but I feel like I\\'ve seen Italian brands that were tapered at least some below the knees. I think the issue I have is that my hips and waist are wider than some people, so a true straight leg cut looks really baggy around my calves and ankles.  I just wanted to point out that the Nordstrom Rack usually has their own tailor, and they\\'ll give you a discount if you bought the item there.  That said, the even hemline just means it\\'s more of a casual shirt that\\'s meant to be untucked.  They should be able to hem it however you want. Depending on where you are, places will use it on the road, but since the stuff pretty much kills any plant it touches over time, some places don\\'t use it on the roads (here in CO they don\\'t).  However, it\\'s used all over the place on private property, especially on stairs and sidewalks, so in places that have much of a winter the stuff is damn near unavoidable.  It\\'s why I refuse to wear anything with a leather sole until I\\'m pretty sure it\\'s not going to snow again til next winter. Yes, I\\'m sure my Daltons were meant for coal mining. Yes, the ancestors of these boots were made for work.  But now they\\'re purely a fashion item.  Just like Iron Rangers, which are styled in a classic Americana way, but given the fact that they have a leather sole and zero traction and no real protection for your toes, you\\'d probably be insane for using them for real work.\\n\\nMy point is, however, that if you want to go out and take your boots and drag them through the mud and beat them up because it gives them more character, then cool, good for you.  If someone else is saying, \"Hey, I dropped $350 on these boots and that\\'s a lot of money to me, so I want to keep them shiny and baby them and hope they last forever,\" then that\\'s cool too.  There\\'s no \"You\\'re using this thing that you bought with your own money *the wrong way* and you shouldn\\'t be allowed to do that.\"  People can try and keep their boots pristine if they want to, and there\\'s nothing wrong with that, and there\\'s a pretty goddamn wide spectrum of styles that constitutes \"boots\", too. Oh yeah?  I actually have the J Crew Iron Rangers and I thought that the cork rubber was exclusive to them.  TIL.  I think the basic point still stands, though. If you have a beard, look into the Andis T-Outliner trimmer. I had been using crappy trimmers I picked up from Target for years and they always fell apart after awhile. A corded trimmer works a lot better and is much more durable. I should\\'ve gotten one years ago. You\\'ll need to purchase a set of guides separately, though.  I wear Daltons with jeans all the time. I don\\'t know why you\\'d think they\\'d be too dressy, especially when you\\'re wearing a sport coat.  Just started on Rum Punch after finishing Out of Sight. Elmore Leonard has an interesting writing style and it\\'s a nice change of pace from some of the longer stuff I read. I had just finished up Shogun and was not really in the mood for another book over 1000 pages.  Anathem gets a lot better if you make it through the first half. But yeah, the pacing in that book is really off.  Yeah that\\'s true. You really have to like a story that meanders a fair amount to get into Stephenson, and like all his random asides. But Anathem was particularly bad, since the actual plot didn\\'t start until like 500 pages in. I thought the second half was pretty good, though.  I\\'ve just kinda accepted that I\\'m not a sneaker guy. The closest I get is Chucks.  I dunno, I like his Black Fleece stuff a lot. Little twists on classic designs that make them look a bit more lively without looking too out there. But then again, I\\'m someone who looks at, say, Rick Owens and thinks, \"I get what he\\'s going for here but I can\\'t imagine when I\\'d ever actually wear any of that stuff.\"  Realistically? My Tevas.  I can\\'t wait for winter to end so that I can wear something that is not a pair of boots. Starting to eye some Rancourts in anticipation of summer.  Yeah, this is how I feel. If one of my male friends told me to about doing this to a woman he didn\\'t know, had never even talked to, I would be like, \"Dude that\\'s totally creepy.\"  Going down on a girl once, and she says, \"Oooh, I like what you\\'re doing to my feet\", and I\\'m like, \"Uhhh, that\\'s not me, that appears to be the cat.\" Nope. Everyone has a different refractory period.  I recommend you just start going down on her and taking it nice and slow, and you\\'ll probably be ready soon enough. Just a couple of weeks ago, I\\'m doing...something or other, I don\\'t even remember, but I inch back on her tiny little twin bed, and...fall backwards and land on my head.  Now, that doesn\\'t really slow me down, but she starts cracking up and just needs to take a break. My cat was licking the girl\\'s foot. My cat was only about 5 months old at the time, so I ended up carrying her out of the room and saying, \"Calamity, you can\\'t watch this, this is adult content.\"  I\\'ve always found that if you step on them enough times, they learn not to lurk under foot. (That and you learn to look out more.)  Dark wash is just a bit of a cleaner look. It makes it so you can wear slightly less casual stuff with it. I can\\'t really picture wearing a sport coat with light wash jeans.  [Outfit today] ( http://imgur.com/3lYk2c3)\\n\\n[Detail on shirt] ( http://imgur.com/sYTMQgL)\\n\\nGBV, Japan Blue, Katahdins\\n\\nLove the shirt with the subtle Black Watch pattern. Wondering if wearing it with the jeans is too blue, though. I need to get some denim that\\'s not blue.\\n\\n[Outfit yesterday] (http://imgur.com/C5dip1n)\\n\\nJ Crew, Bonobos, Red Wing\\n\\nI probably need to get the chinos hemmed. I have a 33 inch inseam so pants rarely fit OTR. So I ordered a GBV shirt off of myhabit. It came, and while it\\'s a great shirt, the thing had really really obviously been worn, washed, and tossed into the dryer. So I call their support and complain about it, and the guy is like, \"Oh, well, it says right here it\\'s *vintage* so that means it was pre-owned.\" So after explaining to the guy that it\\'s just the name of the brand, he eventually says, \"Well, I can either give you a full refund, or give you a discount.\" I decided to take the $20 discount, which means I got a once worn GBV shirt for $55. Not bad, I think, and it is a beautiful shirt. \\n\\nAlso have a date tonight that I\\'m a little nervous about. Been awhile since I met someone so promising. I struck up a conversation with her when I saw her reading a book in a busy bar and we hit it off. I do love cute nerdy girls.  I mean, this had the distinctive look of where you wash a shirt and then just left it crinkled up in a laundry basket, so I really have trouble believing someone would sell a new shirt that way. I could be wrong. But I also remember that I had wait listed the shirt and then got an email later that it had become available, so that suggests that someone had bought it and returned it.  YouTube is like Facebook in that a lot of the value comes not from how good it is, but how many people use it.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t remember. It wasn\\'t an author I had heard of. It didn\\'t sound like she was all that into the book. I think someone had given it to her a gift.  I think there\\'s still some Bonobos on sale at Nordstrom. Check the web site. Probably limited sizes, but I have a couple of pairs and like them a lot. '"
